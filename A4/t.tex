\section{Problem 1}
	Question 1 was more a .txt file manipulation question than interacting with the outside world. The hardest part was getting the marks on the graph correct with R. I used the script scores.py to simplify the list from a key,value setup to just a single list of numbers sorted by value. This same script also prints out the values for mean, median, and standard deviation. I placed the markers for this manually, as well as the text that labels each listed value.

\section{Question 2}
	Question 2 was harder, but it was all information we'd worked with before. I setup the script twt.py to generate a file that matches the format of question 1's acnwala-friendscount.csv. This was done so I could use the same script to geneate output for this question. It was here that I made the python script use a function instead of hard coding all the values in, this made automation easier.

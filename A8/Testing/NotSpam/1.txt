Let me talk to John on Monday and get some insight from him.

This may be another opportunity to connect with some industry programmers. Tim Kubinak and I have been working with Lockheed Martin on a high school competition they are running called Code Quest on April 21 at their Suffolk facility (Google it for details). At one time they asked me if I knew any programmers that would be willing to volunteer for the event. Their programmers are working it but there are a lot of teams registered. Volunteers will guide teams and support them if a team gets stuck. Someone I know from ODU, John Asija, is wanting to get his foot in the door at Lockheed so he is volunteering to make a connection with LM personnel. Your son may know John. The gentleman we are working with at Lockheed is James Richardson, I believe his son is in the same program as John at ODU so your son may know both of them. If interested, I can see if they are still looking for programmers to volunteer. Might be a good connection down the road.

One tip I have learned from James is that most industries use software to scan resumes so it imperative that key concepts in job description postings be included in his resume. You can't get past that initial scan if you don't.

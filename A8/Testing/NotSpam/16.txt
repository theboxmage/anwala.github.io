"I am interested in pursing a job with your company.

As a senior in Computer Science at Old Dominion University, one of our required courses is a basic intro to Linux course. After taking that course I began to do all of my course work on a personal Linux laptop. For the last 2 years I used Arch Linux, but have recently switched to Ubuntu for an easier time connecting to university wifi. "

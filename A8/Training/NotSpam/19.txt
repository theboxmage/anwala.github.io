	Hi Joshua, 	
	Beginner creators often praise Unity’s detailed documentation. Not only are editor features and functions clearly described, but most provide examples in C#.

As a beginner developer, you have two paths. You can learn visual scripting with editor extensions like Playmaker, where you can create your vision without knowing how to program.

Or, like a majority of Unity game devs, you can learn the powerful C# language. Here are some resources to help you start learning C#:

	And for you book lovers, there are plenty of choices out there, including Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity 5.x - Second Edition and Unity in Action: Multiplatform Game Development in C# with Unity 5.

Yours in development,

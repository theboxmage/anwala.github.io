Dear Joshua,

Effective May 1st, 2018 the convenience fee associated with credit/debit card payments on the billing portal will increase from 2.75% to 2.85%. Consider using the electronic checking option to avoid the convenience fee. All you need to successfully submit an electronic check is the routing number, account number, and billing address associated with your checking account. The easiest way to obtain and verify this information would be to refer to a paper check. Please see the example below:
DO NOT submit an electronic check with information from a credit card convenience check, money market account, or a savings account as it will be returned. Student accounts will be charged a $50 returned check fee if a check payment is returned. NO EXCEPTIONS will be made in waiving a returned check fee. Should you have any questions please call the Student Accounts Team at 757-683-3030. You can also stop by the Student Accounts Office located on the 1st floor of Rollins Hall. Have a good day Monarchs and finish the semester strong!
Sincerely,
Delores White
Director of Student Accounts

Do you take advantage of wrong answers? Do you consider what they tell you, why they happened, or what you might do next? In this webinar, John SanGiovanni addresses actions that teachers can take to mine the gaps in student understanding. It examines a process for selecting quality tasks, anticipating student thinking, determining evidence of understanding and misunderstanding, and identifying next steps. The webinar will feature mathematics tasks K-2, 3-5, and 6-8 grade bands.

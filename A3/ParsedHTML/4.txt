If you haven't heard of it before, Yuri on Ice is a sports anime about a Japanese figure skater named Yuri Katsuki. The show follows Yuri, his coach and longtime idol Victor Nikiforov, and a host of international skaters as they compete in the Figure Skating Grand Prix.

The show has gained a huge online following and garnered praise for its depiction of the same-sex relationship between the two protagonists.
The song Suzaki and Kihara skated to is the piece Yuri used for his free skate throughout the Grand Prix competitions. Itâ€™s an emotionally charged song because Yuri's free skates are where you see most of his growth as an athlete and as a person throughout the season.
Anime fans were overwhelmed by Friday's routine.

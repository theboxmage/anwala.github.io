The official start of the
2018 Pyeongchang Olympics is finally here. The opening ceremony kicked off with the lighting of the Olympic flame and the flag parade, when participating countries are introduced. North Korean and South Korean delegations marched together under one unified flag, the biggest sign yet of a detente after months of tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program. 
When all eyes aren’t on the athletes, they’ll be on the world leaders who are gathering for the Winter Games, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jung. Her
historic visit raises the stakes at an Olympics already filled with heightened geopolitical tensions.

Vice President Pence reportedly did not stand when the joint Korean delegation entered at the Winter Olympics opening ceremonies.
Pence, who led the U.S. delegation to the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was seated next to the host country’s President Moon Jae-in, as well as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Pence only stood for the U.S. team, according to The Associated Press , though others seated near Pence stood and applauded for the Korean delegation. Athletes from North and South Korea marched together under a single flag.

North Korean officials, including Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, were seated one row behind Pence. The vice president’s visit to the Olympics comes during a time of tension between the U.S. and North Korea.
Pence also briefly attended an Olympic reception on Thursday, and shook hands with all heads of state besides North Korea’s ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong Nam.
The vice president was supposed to sit across from the North Korean head of state at the dinner, but reportedly showed up late and was not able to be seated.
The Winter Olympics have helped ease tensions between North and South Korea, despite the North’s continued development and demonstration of its nuclear capabilities. Pence has said that he is open to meeting with North Korean officials during his visit.

Fresh off the release of his latest studio album Man of the Woods and his so-so performance at the Super Bowl halftime show, Justin Timberlake has announced a new limited-edition clothing line. Each of the 16 songs on the new album has received a corresponding collaboration with a notable designer. There are sneakers for “Higher Higher,” a flask for “Sauce,” and, well, flannel for “Flannel.” The items will be available at a New York City pop-up shop that opens tomorrow, February 9. Below, check out the full list of collabs (via GQ ), as well as previews of the merch, including another flannel for “ Hers (Interlude) ,” though it doesn’t look anything like the one Jessica Biel described.

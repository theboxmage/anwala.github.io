South Korea formally kicked off the 2018 Winter Olympics at 6 a.m. ET with the Opening Ceremony — due to the time difference, NBC is streaming the ceremony live on certain platforms and then airing it on television at 8 p.m. The two-hour special and completion of the Olympic Torch Relay will be South Korea’s chance to make a big first impression during its first Winter Olympics hosting gig.

Earlier in the day, tensions were even higher when hundreds of anti-North Korean protestors scuffled with police outside the stadium. Some even burnt North Korean flags and pictures of Kim Jong-un.

These athletes are technically independents despite the uniform, an appeal to admit 45 more failed just that morning. But there were some lighthearted moments as well, it was a performance with all the usual pageantry. And the flag bearer from Tonga stole the show, when he showed up oiled and topless despite the below freezing temperatures.

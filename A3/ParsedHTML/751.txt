'Marching together sends a powerful message of peace to the world'
More from Thomas Bach, the crowd are loving this.
He continues: "A great example of this unifying power is the joint march here tonight of the two teams from the National Olympic Committees of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We thank you.
"All the athletes around me, all the spectators here in the stadium, and all Olympic fans watching around the world… we are all touched by this wonderful gesture. We all join and support you in your message of peace.
"United in our diversity, we are stronger than all the forces that want to divide us. Two years ago in Rio de Janeiro, with the first ever Refugee Olympic Team, the IOC sent a powerful message of hope to the world. Now in Pyeongchang, the athletes from the teams of the ROK and DPRK, by marching together, send a powerful message of peace to the world. Let us share this Olympic experience with the world. Let’s go together, Pyeongchang!"

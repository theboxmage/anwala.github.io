-- Two-time Chinese champion Yan Han also had trouble staying on his feet, but at least he had Christina Perri 's "A Thousand Years" to think about it.
I’ll be honest, I just downloaded the version of “A Thousand Years” Han Yan just skated to. #Olympics #PyongChang2018 #figureskating

-- 2014 Olympic silver medalist Canadian Patrick Chan took it super old school with a routine to Kansas ' FM rock classic "Dust in the Wind," which is where his chances seemed to go when he dinked his first quad jump. 
"Dust In the Wind" will always remind me of Old School, and that's all I can think of during Patrick Chan's skate ⛸️ for Team Canada ---- #Olympics pic.twitter.com/0qzi9OInTm

-- All eyes were on U.S. hopeful and two-time U.S. champ Nathan Chen, who gave it his best to Benjamin Clementine 's jazzy pop tune "Nemesis." On this night, though, gravity would be the 18 year-old nemesis due to a couple major slips.
Nathan Chen skated to “Nemesis” by @MrBClementine so he obviously has excellent taste in music. Go @nathanwchen !! #TeamUSA #WinterOlympics

-- After a predictable selection of classical and pop opera selections in the pair's short program in the team competition, five-time French champion pair Vanessa James and Morgan Cipres brought a little heat thanks to Ed Sheeran 's "Make it Rain," which, if we're not mistaken, represents Ed's official Winter Olympics debut.
Now the #French #figureskating couple got my attention with their music. Make it Rain by @edsheeran . James and Cipres how about some #Prince in the individual event. #Olympics pic.twitter.com/uDSznVqdS1

2018 Winter Olympics: Team Bermuda sports shorts in the bitter cold opening ceremony
Martin Rogers, Josh Peter  |  USA TODAY
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — It wasn’t the first time that the delegation from Bermuda had worn bright red shorts for the opening ceremony of an Olympics and not the first time that cross-country skier Tucker Murphy had caused a stir with them.
It was the first time, however, that the natty Bermuda shorts synonymous with the Caribbean territory had gotten an appearance in temperatures that dipped into the 20s at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.
Friday was a night for dressing warmly, with most of the visitors from around the world clad in hats, boots and thick insulated jackets. Not so Murphy, who will compete in the men’s 15k competition and will need to do more than red shorts in bone-chilling weather if he wants to impress Dexter Smith, editor of Bermuda’s Royal Gazette newspaper.
“That’s normal,’’ Smith said. “At the Olympic Games, winter or summer, we’re pretty much famous for our Bermuda shorts. …It’s not a novelty. Not be any stretch.’’
Our thoughts? Brrrr.

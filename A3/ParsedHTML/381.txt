The NHL isn’t sending its stars to the Olympics this year. But there are plenty of players on several teams who could be future NHL stars.
For the first time since 1994, the best NHL players will not be taking part in the Winter Olympics. Instead, the best players playing in Europe, Asia, and the NCAA will play in Pyeongchang, South Korea. While the majority of players on the 12 teams taking part in the tournament are NHL washouts, there are several young players who could be future potential stars in the NHL.
5. Ryan Donato — United States
Ryan Donato’s father Ted represented the United States at the 1992 Winter Olympics and played 796 games in the NHL. Like his father, Donato went to Harvard, where he is currently a junior and plays for his father, who is the head coach. After playing his first two seasons on the wing, Harvard shifted Donato to his natural position of center to start his junior season. In 89 games with the Crimson, Donato has scored 54 goals and 90 points. Again following in his father’s footsteps, Donato was drafted by the Boston Bruins in the second round of the 2014 NHL draft, 56th overall.
Donato will likely slot into the American team’s top six forwards for head coach Tony Granato in Pyeongchang and could receive time on the power-play. Granato will likely use Donato on the wing, where he will have fewer defensive responsibilities. Bruins general manager Don Sweeney described Donato as a player with an excellent skill set, with a good shot and unbelievable release. Sweeney believes that Donato is close to being NHL-ready.
If Donato decides to leave school after his junior season, he could finish the year with the Bruins. However, given that Donato’s father is the head coach at Harvard, Donato could decide to return for his senior season.

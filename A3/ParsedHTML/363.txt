Shoutout to the Nigerian bobsled team. I am rooting for them SO HARD.   #OpeningCeremonies
Some fans also voiced their interest in a remake of Cool Runnings, the 1993 film that portrayed the Jamaican bobsled team’s historic qualification for the 1988 Winter Olympics.
Frankly I DEMAND a remake of Cool Runnings about the Nigerian Women's Bobsled team. #OpeningCeremony #Olympics

The members of the Nigerian bobsled team and Adeagbo had arduous journeys to the Winter Olympics. The bobsled team formed a GoFundMe in 2016 to aid their journey, and Adeagbo tried skeleton for the first time after failing to qualify twice at the U.S. Olympic Trials in the triple jump in 2004 and 2008.
Adigun, the bobsled team member who initially formed the GoFundMe, created a wooden sled to train, and she and her teammates paused their careers to pursue their Olympics dreams.
“I can’t wait to get on that stage and give people every ounce of our passion,” Adigun told TIME of competing at the Olympics.

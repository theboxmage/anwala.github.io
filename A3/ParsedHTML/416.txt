The shirtless Tongan flag-bearer is back in Pyeongchang, and he still doesn't have a shirt on.
Pita Taufatofua didn't let below-freezing temperatures at Friday's Winter Olympics opening ceremony stop him from showing off the oiled, muscled torso that made him a sensation during the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Taufatofua, 34, who competed in taekwondo in Rio, improbably qualified for the Winter Olympics as a cross-country skier last month.
 A few days ago, Taufatofua said he would be fully clothed during the ceremony. He apparently had a change of heart. AP
He is Tonga's only representative in Pyeongchang, and the first Olympic cross-country skier from the Polynesian archipelago in history.

His glistening torso certainly made an impression on social media:

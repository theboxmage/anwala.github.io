Alpine Skier Lindsey Vonn Conquers the World
World Cup champion skier Lindsey Vonn slaloms into our Studio to tell us exactly what it feels like to be the world's best at what she does! You might be surprised to learn, though, that skiing is not her #1 sport of choice! Find out what other sports she has dabbled in, including one for which she was deemed too tall, and also hear about her experience making one lucky high schooler the coolest guy at the prom! Hosted by Nikki Novak.

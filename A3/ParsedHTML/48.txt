When the world sees differences, a mom sees boundless potential. For the Winter Olympics 2018, we’re honoring a mom’s role in helping her kids overcome the world’s bias. Just imagine what the world could be if we all saw each other through a mom’s loving eyes. Thank you, Mom.

At P&G we aspire to a world where everyone is equally free to pursue their dreams, no matter who you are, where you come from, who you love, or how you worship. We’re using our voice as an Olympic Games sponsor to celebrate a mom’s role in helping her kids overcome bias and seeing their potential no matter what others see. Just imagine what the world could be if we all saw each other through a mom’s eyes.
Thank You, Mom.

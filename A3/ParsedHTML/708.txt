Speed skater Shani Davis has boycotted the opening ceremony at the winter Olympics after a coin toss was used to decide who would lead out the U.S. delegation.
That decision put luge star Erin Hamlin at the front of the pack. On Friday, she beamed a broad smile as she carried the U.S. flag in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to the tune of "Gangnam Style."
Hamlin, 31, was chosen in a coin toss with Davis, 35, one of just a few black athletes on Team USA. That coin flip came after the two tied 4-4 in a vote among eight U.S. winter sport federations.
But Davis was angry, saying he should have been picked and suggesting that race played a role in the selection.
I am an American and when I won the 1000m in 2010 I became the first American to 2-peat in that event. @TeamUSA dishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer. No problem. I can wait until 2022. #BlackHistoryMonth2018 #PyeongChang2018 pic.twitter.com/dsmTtNkhJs

Davis didn't say how the coin was "dishonorably tossed."
Hamlin said in a statement that she was "honored and excited" to be named flag-bearer, adding "this is something totally different."
"It's something that is because of that hard work. People acknowledge that and respect that. It's a big privilege to represent Team USA," she said.

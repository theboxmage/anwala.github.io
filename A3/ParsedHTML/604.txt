PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (AP) _ No national anthems for the athletes from North and South Korea. Instead, the combined team marched into Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium united in song.
The teams, which walked under a single "unification" flag, entered to the tune of "Arirang" _ a traditional old folk song that is beloved in both regions.
The song has many versions with different melodies and lyrical variations _ depending on the region _ the most popular of which is a sad tune about a lover who has left. It includes the lyric: "My love, who has left me, you won't be able to go 10 'li' before your feet get sore."
The desire to be reunited made it seemingly fitting to be used as an unofficial anthem for reunification between the North and South Korean athletes for the Olympics _ and for other events during which Koreans made a statement for peace.
Later during the opening ceremony, "Jeongseon Arirang" is sung by an elderly man as endless buckwheat flowers bloom onstage and create a river. Five children cross the river on a raft, but a storm appears _ and the buckwheat flowers bloom again to create a safe haven in a bountiful field. The children head toward a bright city as fireflies rise from the flowers.
South Korea's Yuna Kim, a gold medalist in 2010 and a silver medalist in 2014, skated to the song at the 2011 World Figure Skating Championships.
"Jeongseon Arirang" is most often sung in the Gangwon Province _ where Pyeongchang is located. Film director Kim Ki-duk has often sung "Arirang" while accepting awards and screening some of his movies. He also made a self-portrait doumentary called "Arirang" that was released in 2011.
"Arirang" has also been the subject of hundreds of songs, stories and films since the early 1900s.

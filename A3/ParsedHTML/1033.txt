What's up with the gloves?
If you've seen the opening ceremony for the 2018 Olympic Games, you've probably noticed the most eye-catching part of the American athletes' uniform - the fringed suede gloves.
This year, designer Ralph Lauren dressed them in very cozy red, white, and blue knit sweaters, "USA" beanies, jeans, boots, and heated parkas. However, many folks on social media wondered about the suede gloves with fringe falling down the side and beaded with an American flag and the five Olympic rings. 
The gloves' origin is right here in the Adirondacks of Upstate New York.  Sunderland Leather Company in Gloversville provided the leather to produce the gloves.

Olympics
How did Sunderland get a gig with the 2018 Olympics? 
It all started with good business. The company has worked extensively with Peter Kiernan of Olympia Gloves in Elmsford. About eight months ago, Kiernan was looking for a supplier for a project with Ralph Lauren and he knew Sunderland's leather would be top notch. 
The leather used for the U.S. athletes' gloves are made of North American bison. Owner Matthew Smrtic said it's a strong rugged leather that is very durable with good insulation.
Sunderland has worked with Ralph Lauren on different projects and has provided leather for their gloves for many years.

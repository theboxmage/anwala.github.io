The Olympics kicked off Friday in South Korea, and it was nothing short of spectacular.
Plenty of fireworks and elaborate lights adorned Pyeongchang’s brand-new 35,000-seater Olympic Stadium, which welcomed 90 nations and one team of Russian athletes during the opening ceremony.
Many are highlighting the display of peace between North Korea and South Korea, whose athletes marched together under the Korean unification flag. Despite high-profile tension between the two neighboring countries since the 1950s, things looked peachy as the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un shook hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Perhaps even crazier, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence looked unfazed as he sat right in front of her throughout the opening ceremony despite North Korea’s fairly recent threats of nuclear war .

Politics aside, these photos are sure to get you hyped for the next two weeks. The flaming dancers were the icing on the cake, personally.

As a teenager, Sokoli fled Kosovo after being shot and stabbed in the war there, he has said. 
He moved to New York in 1999, and has since married had had three children. 
In January of 2017, he entered a downhill skiing race and despite having not been on skis in 20 years, he won.
His sights set on the Olympics, Sokoli rises daily at 5.30am to go to the gym,  drops the kids off at school, goes to work, comes home to have dinner and spend time with his family and then returns to his training.
His training in the boiler room uses a machine called the Skier's Edge, a workout machine that conditions the muscles used in skiing.
Sokoli met his wife Flutura in the US, and the happy couple now have three children

Though he dropped skiing around the age of 15 after fleeing Kosovo, Sokoli does have an edge in that his father was a ski instructor in the country. 
No matter what the outcome at the winter games, Sokoli expects to remain upbeat throughout.
'Being from Kosovo and having survived the war, and being that I live in Brooklyn and that I'm a father, a married man and a boxer, my mentality is strong,' he has said on his website . 
'Sometimes people don't understand why I'm so happy and content with my life. You don't know how it is to be under the sniper or God forbid, you could stand on a mine or get shot or stabbed again. That's why I'm always happy and smiling.'

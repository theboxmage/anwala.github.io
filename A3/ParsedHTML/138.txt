They spoke so much during Team USA's entrance into the stadium that they had to skip the entrance of SEVEN other nations just because they were blabbing about Murica and showing scenes of Team USA taking selfies and that sorta crap... ugh. Furthermore, one of their remarks was just outright offensive. It was when Lebanon entered the stadium, Katie talked about Lebanon, being a small country, didn't really have a likelihood of winning any metals, but she admired their smiles and determination.. bla bla bla. Me being Lebanese... like wow, that HURTS, can you shut the FRICK up? Talk about logorrhea... I hate Katie Couric now

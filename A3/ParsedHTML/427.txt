Bleacher Report's self-proclaimed bold prediction has the U.S. men's hockey team — which features two Minnesotans — taking home gold.
The women's hockey team — featuring seven Minnesotans — is looking for revenge and its first gold since the sport's inaugural appearance at the 1998 games. But both The Associated Press and Sports Illustrated say Team USA will finish behind Canada — again. The United States lost to Canada in 2014 and 2010. The U.S. settled for silver behind Canada in 2002 as well.
Skiier Lindsey Vonn is favored by The Associated Press and Sports Illustrated to win downhill gold.

• The men's curling team could take home a bronze medal behind Canada and Sweden, says the AP.

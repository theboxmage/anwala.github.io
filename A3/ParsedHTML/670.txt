While waiting for the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony to begin on NBC (seriously, it took 30 minutes for the event to actually kick in) people fell in love with United States team speed skater Maame Biney.
NBC conducted an interview with the Reston, Virginia, resident, before they showed the ceremony. Her bubbly spirit and infectious smile cheered up a lot viewers.

The Winter Olympics have begun and it’s hard to say which we’re enjoying more: the incredible displays of athletic prowess, or Leslie Jones’ hilarious live-tweeting about the games.
Yes, the "Saturday Night Live" star is back with her hysterical Twitter commentary on the Olympics , and she kicked off opening day in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with a series of delightful reactions to the figure skating competitions.
She's also clearly got her Olympics look down.
Wow yâall had a party with that post lmao. If there is anyone in the world who loves themselves that is me! It was just a single woman complaining post. Thanks for the love but I think yâall misunderstood . love everything about me just ready for a man to do the same. CHEAH!! pic.twitter.com/rBFwrtns09

In a series of tweets, Jones weighed in on everything from the skaters’ moves to the commentators’ bedazzled headsets. She dropped plenty of truth bombs along the way, including one that pretty much sums up our feelings about figure skating : “Wish I could ice skate but I don’t want to die.”
Here are some of her funniest Olympics tweets so far. Pro tip: Turn the volume up.
(Warning: A few of these videos contain brief instances of adult language.)

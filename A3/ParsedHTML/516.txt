South Korea has been invaded by a North Korean army - an 'army of beauties'.
Over 200 glamorous North Korean cheerleaders have arrived in South Korea for the Olympic Winter Games.
The young women crossed the Demilitarised Zone on Wednesday (local time) between the two countries to cheer athletes from both sides. They have been dubbed the 'army of beauties', apparently handpicked for their looks by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un himself.
Each wore a stunning red coat with matching fur hats, collars and cuffs. Other uniforms include a smart red blazer with gold epaulettes.
Their outfits have sparked fashion envy around the world.
"By the way, I love the North Korean cheering squad's outfit. It's quite something! I want that hat!" said one South Korea fan on Twitter, according to the Straits Times.
"I don't want to say it but North Korea's cheering squad is quite pretty. You can throw stones at me but the truth is the truth," another observer said on Twitter.

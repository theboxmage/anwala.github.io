For the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic games in Vancouver, Ralph Lauren kept Team USA in the same white pants and black boots from the opening ceremony, but swapped out the puffer coats for a navy and red cardigan, and traded the beanies for navy blue caps that look like something straight out of Newsies.

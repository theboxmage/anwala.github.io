It is going to be frigid! This winter I will #PlungeWith Special Olympics Illinois at the 2018 Law Enforcement Torch Run Polar Plunge. That is right! I have committed to “be bold and get cold” for the 22,000 Special Olympics athletes participating across Illinois.
While I’m getting cold just thinking about it, I’m excited to join the thousands of warm-hearted individuals that will participate in the Polar Plunge.  While my Plunge promises to be a little frigid, I do not mind because I am supporting the amazing athletes of Special Olympics Illinois.
To jump into the frigid waters, I have set a personal fundraising goal and I need your help to reach it!  Any amount is appreciated – it all goes to one “cool” cause and gets me that much closer to my icy dip.  Best of all, your donation helps provide athletes with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to participate in Special Olympics programs and reveal their inner champion.
Donating through this site is simple, fast, and secure. It is also the most efficient way to make a contribution to my Polar Plunge efforts and show your support for Special Olympics Illinois.  If you would like to #PlungeWith me or learn more about this “official event of winter,” visit  www.plungeillinois.com  for all of the chilly details.
Thanks in advance for your support – and don't forget to forward this to anyone who you think might want to donate too!

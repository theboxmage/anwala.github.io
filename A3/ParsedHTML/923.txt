Three Nigerian wrestlers have qualified for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games courtesy of their performance at the ongoing African Wrestling Championships in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
The wrestlers are Sunmisola Balogun, Aina Ohida and Esther Asaolu. Each of them won gold respectively at the championships.
The trio will compete in Nigeria’s colours at the Games slated for Buenos Aires, Argentina later this year.
Speaking on the development, President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Daniel Igali said the athletes were on the verge of achieving the target set by the federation.
“I think they did well, all the athletes wrestled with a lot of guts,” he said.
“We have four Olympic slots from the cadet girls. That’s unbelievable! I remember the last time we were able to go with one girl to the (Youth) Olympics.
“We have set a target of achieving about 5 or 6 slots, and it looks like we are on course.”
Meanwhile, Team Nigeria is leading the medal table after winning 21 medals, made up of 9 gold, 5 silver and 7 bronze medals.
In the women category, the team won 10 medal- six gold, two silver and two bronze- while men have 11 medals of three gold, three silver and five bronze.
The medals were won in the concluded events of cadet Freestyle, cadet Greco-Roman and cadet women’s Wrestling.

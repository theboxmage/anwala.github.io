While Tonga’s well-oiled and shirtless flag bearer’s triumphant return sent tongues wagging during the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea , it wasn’t the only viral moment during the event, something that Team USA can attest to.
American athletes entered the Olympic arena in Pyeongchang dressed in Ralph Lauren-designed uniforms, including a pair of ornately fringed, seemingly Western-inspired leather USA Olympic gloves, which effectively stole the sartorial spotlight of the Winter Games.
As might be expected, the Internet basically lost their minds over these ostentatious accessories, with many of the viewers weighing in online on exactly how they felt about Team USA’s gloves.
This Twitter user thought the Team USA Winter Olympics apparel bore a striking resemblance to a pair worn by Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber.

He wasn’t the only one who noticed the similarity.

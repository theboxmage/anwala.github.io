Ross Miner, Nathan Chen, Vincent Zhou, and Adam Rippon, the first openly gay US Winter Olympian, at the US Figure Skating Championships last month.

The piece, titled "In Olympics, let's focus on the winner of the race — not the race of the winner," criticized a US Olympic official for praising the diversity of this year's US athletes and caused outrage after it was published Wednesday.
"That was followed by a, frankly, embarrassing laundry list of how many African-Americans, Asians and openly gay athletes are on this year’s US team," wrote John Moody, the executive vice president and executive editor for Fox News. "No sport that we are aware of awards points — or medals — for skin color or sexual orientation."
"Unless it’s changed overnight, the motto of the Olympics, since 1894, has been 'Faster, Higher, Stronger,'" he wrote. "It appears the US Olympic Committee would like to change that to 'Darker, Gayer, Different.'"

Below is the schedule for Massachusetts athletes. You may see some weird times because of the 14 hour difference between Boston and Pyeongchang. The times listed are Boston local times so there will be a few events where a late night or a DVR will be required. The schedule is subject to change and a televised delay.
Some preliminary round events may not air in favor of other events. All events can be seen on NBCOlympics.com
We'll also be posting the results here as well.

Haley Joy will be staying back in New York City with Kotb's boyfriend, Joel Schiffman, while she's in Pyeongchang, South Korea for the Winter Games. 
The Today co-anchor recently opened up about Schiffman's reaction to her adopting Haley Joy  during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres. 
“I had thought about having kids for a long, long time. But one day I was sitting with my boyfriend and I said to him, ‘I’m going to have to talk to you about something because I can’t push it down anymore, push it away,’” Kotb recalled. “I said, ‘Don’t answer now. Take a day, take a week, take some time. But I want to talk to you about this.’ And he said, ‘OK, what is it?’ And I said, ‘I would like to explore adoption with you.’”
“He looked at me and said, ‘I don’t need a day,’” she continued.  “And I knew I’d chosen the right man.”

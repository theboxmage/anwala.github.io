Delegations from the United States and North Korea are present at the Winter Olympics this year, so the games present a fairly unique opportunity for international diplomacy this year. Of course, the last few months have been rife with tension on that front, and two pranksters decided to take advantage of it and cause a scene.
Two men impersonating President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un showed up in the stands during the Opening Ceremony. The comedians told observers that they were there to promote peace between their two nations, and while it isn’t clear whether the display was noticed by Jong-un’s sister and her fellow envoys, the two drew significant attention from the media.

The two were escorted out by security, but they clearly made the opening of the Olympics that much more interesting.

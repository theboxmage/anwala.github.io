French former swimming champion Antoine Galavtine, a gold and silver medal winner in international championships, told Sputnik that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is discriminating against Russian athletes.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has rejected appeals by 45 Russian athletes and two coaches challenging the decision of the IOC to exclude them from the Olympics.
"As a former sportsman I am astounded with the recent decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport [on January 9]. It is necessary to punish those who are not clean, but banning athletes with a sterling reputation in sports is discrimination. That means whenever the IOC doesn't like an athlete's nationality, the athlete can be excluded. Even more disturbing is the fact that even CAS wouldn't be able to protect athletes, because its opinion apparently no one takes into account anymore," Galavtine said.

CAS Justifies Rejecting Russian Athletes' Ban Appeals With ROC Suspension
According to the former swimmer, the court made the decision under pressure. Earlier, CAS had fully acquitted 28 Russian athletes and 11 others had their appeals partially upheld. After the court published its decision, President of the IOC Thomas Bach claimed there was a need to reform CAS.
"I think a problem [with doping] exists in every country, but what we are witnessing now is an attempt to get rid of those who can win medals. They have decided that Russia won't win any medals this year," Galavtine said.

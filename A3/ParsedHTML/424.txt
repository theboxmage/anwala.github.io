Day 41 of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic torch relay on Monday featured an appearance by the event's first non-human participant. Robot HUBO was the second torchbearer of the afternoon at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea. Robotics professor Dr. Dennis Hong took the torch on a short trip in a vehicle driven by Robot HUBO. HUBO then carried the torch on its own for 150-metres (yards) and performed a disaster rescue demonstration. The robot torchbearer then passed the flame to Professor Oh Jun-ho - the man responsible for its development as Korea's first humanoid robot. Professor Oh then handed the flame over to FX-2, a human-operated robot that was controlled by a student as the robotic relay continued. Daejeon is known as the science city of South Korea and is home to many research and development corporations and institutions. (Video courtesy: SNTV)

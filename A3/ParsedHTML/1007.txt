$37,500
Each athlete from the USA who wins a gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics will get a money payout of $37,500. While that is not a tremendous amount of money it is up 50% over the $25,000 each gold medal winner got at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.

That's up 50% over the $15,000 that USA silver medal winners got at the 2016 Rio Games.
Bronze Medal
$15,000
That's up 50% over the $10,000 that USA bronze medal winners got at the 2016 Rio Games.

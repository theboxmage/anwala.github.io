Dear athletes and survivors of sexual abuse,
With the Winter Olympics starting today, we write to express solidarity with all the survivors of sexual abuse in sports, from gymnastics to swimming to speed skating and more. 
We support the hundreds of survivors who have called out abuse and cover-ups, as well as the survivors who have chosen not to come forward, and those still being silenced or ignored.
We have been heartbroken and outraged to learn that former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar abused at least 265 women and girls over decades, and that the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) knew and chose to ignore it. We continue to mourn as more reports of rampant abuse going unanswered in other Olympic sports are revealed. 
We condemn the failure of multiple institutions, including the USOC, to believe survivors and take action to protect them. We can only assume there are more survivors in other Olympic sports overseen by the USOC suffering in silence.
The undersigned represent people from all over the country who will be watching the Olympics and thinking of you. We see you. We believe you. And we pledge to keep the pressure on the U.S. Olympic Committee to make sure you are safe.

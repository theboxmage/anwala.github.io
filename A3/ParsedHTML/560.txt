HELLO WORLD! Welcome to Autostraddle’s coverage of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremonies! Get ready for drama, get ready for performative unity, get ready for fashion. Your hosts tonight are me, Alaina L. Monts, and my good friend Mey Rude. From what little news I take in (anxiety, amirite???) I know that this year the games are said to be darker, gayer, and different . I for one am thrilled by this prospect. I also know that the gayest sport, figure skating is getting even gayer with the addition of songs with lyrics! I also know that Mike Pence feels called out and sad because gay athletes want nothing to do with him! Y’all! 2018 is such a blessing!!!! I can’t wait to see what we get tonight, and I can’t wait to talk about it with you! (If you, unlike me actually care about who to root for, Molly wrote a sweet guide to help you out ).
Mey: Hi! I love the Olympics! My family loves the Olympics! My grandpa was a boxing announcer at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, my uncle is in charge of the big replay boards for this year’s Olympics as well as a bunch of past ones. My family comes together and watches the Olympics and roots for the US and Mexico. I have a lot of great memories around the Olympics. I remember when the Olympic committee decided to alternate Olympic years so we got one every two years instead of every four and it was one of the best days of my life. I love the pageantry, I love the Americana, I love the bliss and pure unironic joy, but mostly I love the pageantry. And that pageantry is at it’s highest is tonight at the Opening Ceremonies. I’d like to dedicate this liveblog to all my fellow Olympic fans, as well as my girlfriends who hate the Olympics right now but will learn to love them very soon.

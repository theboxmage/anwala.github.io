HELL YEAH! Look White Pence Just Did At Olympics After They Locked Him Out In The COLD! ‘Merica!
The Olympics is not even entirely underway yet and the world is showing how they feel about the U.S. administration in a disgusting way that’s never been allowed before. Like all other major sporting events since President Donald Trump took office, it’s been an affair of who can come up with the more disparaging act against America and our leadership than the next person.

The women's hockey coach faced some tough decisions after negotiations led to 12 North Korean players being added to her roster on Jan. 25. She had to scratch three of her South Korean players for Saturday's game against Switzerland at the Kwandong Hockey Center.
The North Korean forwards are Kim Un Hyang, Jong Su Hyon and Hwang Chung Gum.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier says there's hope the "tender dialogue" between the Koreas at Pyeongchang will foster an improvement in diplomatic relations beyond the Olympics.
Steinmeier visited the German House in Pyeongchang as medal competition was getting was underway.
He says only months ago there were doubts over North Korea's participation in the Olympics. He says, "Certainly three weeks ago no one would have thought that there would be a united team which entered the stadium together."
The rare invitation to Pyongyang for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, delivered by Kim Jong Un's sister, has accelerated the diplomatic warming.
By those measures, Steinmeier say, "What we're seeing right now is at least a sign." He says he's not sure it can hold long term but notes, "At least you can have hope."

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is not directly addressing news that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a visit, as the two Koreas use the Olympics as an opportunity for renewing ties amid concerns over North Korea's nuclear capabilities.
Pence spokeswoman Alyssa Farah says, "The vice president is grateful that President Moon reaffirmed his strong commitment to the global maximum pressure campaign and for his support for continued sanctions."
Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, delivered the invitation to Moon on Saturday.
Pence has meant to use his trip to the Olympics to caution the South against "falling for" the North's overtures, which in the past have been used as stall tactics to allow for continued development of its nuclear program.

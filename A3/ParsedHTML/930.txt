This Athlete Will Be the First Ghanaian Skeleton Racer to Compete at the Winter Olympics
Ghanaian athlete Akwasi Frimpong just made Winter Olympics history.
Africans are taking over the Winter Olympics, and we couldn't be more ecstatic to see them out here flourishing.
After winning his last qualifying race, Ghanian sportsman Akwasi Frimpong , will be the first athlete to represent his country in the Winter Olympics skeleton competition. This news comes just after Nigerian athlete Simidele Adeagbo became the first African woman to qualify for the same sport last week . Nigeria's women's bobsled team has also made Winter Olympic history as they'll be the first African team to compete in that sport in the upcoming games.
Can you say, Black excellence? I'm sure you can.
Frimpong is not new to winter sports, the Dutch national was previously a member of the Dutch national bobsled team and competed in the Bobsled World Cup in 2013. He made his professional skeleton debut in the IBSF World Championship in Germany last year, after making the move to the sport, reports Konbini .
The athlete helped found the Ghana Confederation of Bobsledding and Skeleton Racing to help promote participation in both sports in his home country.
He spoke to Pulse Ghana last month about why he decided to pursue winter sports rather than a more common game, like football perhaps.
"Through skeleton I'm trying to show people to come out of their comfort zone as much as possible and get into something different. We cannot all be Abedi Pele, we cannot all be Usain Bolt, but we all have talent that we can definitely use."
Frimpong will compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea next month. We'll certainly be rooting for him, and for everybody African for that matter!

It just isn't the Olympics without Leslie Jones and her live-tweets posts . In 2016, during the Summer Olympics in Rio, the Saturday Night Live star kept up a hilarious running commentary of the games on Twitter that quickly went viral. Although she was just doing it for the laughs (and her sheer excitement for Team USA), everyone loved her tweets so much that NBC ended up inviting her to Brazil to be an official commentator â€” complete with her own Snapchat filter .
This year, she's back with another batch of witty one-liners, and not only will she once again be amusing us all from the comfort of her couch, but she'll also be flying to Pyeongchang, South Korea, to reprise her role as an NBC contributor. According to Entertainment Weekly , Leslie will be appearing on TV and digital platforms to cover live events, meet athletes, and "generally share her enthusiasm for the games and Team USA." "Experiencing the Olympics through the lens of Leslie is unlike anything else," Jim Bell, the NBC Olympics production and programming president, said, according to EW. "Her passion for Team USA is contagious, and her adventures in South Korea should be fascinating."
Although we're only a day into the 2018 Winter Olympics , Leslie has already been delivering laughs with her live-tweets. She kicked things off with an opening ceremony of her own, tweeting a video of herself using a stationary bike while decked to the nines in Team USA gear. After that, she hit the ground running with opinions on the figure-skating costumes, original memes, and shout-outs to her favorite designer, Christian Siriano.
Check out some of Leslie's tweets, below.

'We're here. We're queer. Get used to it': Olympians Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon share a kiss and make history as Team USA's first openly gay male athletes at Winter Games
Gus Kenworthy, 26, posted photos of himself and figure skater Adam Rippon, 28, at the Opening ceremony for the 2018 Winter Olympics
The pair are the first openly gay male athletes to compete for Team USA in the Winter Games, and have been lauded by Hillary Clinton and Tyler Oakley 
Team USA also has a third out athlete at the Games this year, speed skater Brittany Bowe, who also competed in Sochi back in 2014
Bowe and Kenworthy, who won Silver in the Slopestyle back in 2014, both publicly came out as gay after the Sochi Games 
'Representing USA is one of the greatest honors of my life and being able to do it as my authentic self makes it all so much sweeter,' said Rippon in his first Games

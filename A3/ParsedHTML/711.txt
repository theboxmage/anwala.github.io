Is it too cold for the Winter Olympics?
Hamlin - who will race in her fifth and final Games - and Davis were among eight nominees for the flag bearer role.
They were tied at four votes each after an athlete from each of the USA's eight winter sports federations held a ballot on Wednesday.
It had already been agreed prior to the vote by the US Olympic Committee that a tie would be broken by a coin toss, and they later defended their selection method.
"The Team USA flag bearer is selected using a detailed selection procedure that is fully driven by athletes," said spokesman Mark Jones
"As is always the case, there were many worthy candidates for this year's honour and we look forward to having four-time Olympian Erin Hamlin lead our delegation into the opening ceremony."
Speaking before Davis' tweet, Hamlin said her family would be thrilled to watch her carry the flag.
"They're really pumped," she said. "We've grown up watching the Olympics and we're always like, 'Who's going to be carrying the flag?' And to actually be that person is insane."
Hamlin's team-mate Jayson Terdiman added that it is "one of the coolest things".
He said: "Not just does Erin get to hold that flag, but USA Luge gets to hold that flag. It's so cool. It's a great honour for our small sport."
US speed skater Joey Mantia, a team-mate of Davis, accepted the decision.
"We feel strongly toward Shani and they felt strongly for Erin," he said. "That's just that."

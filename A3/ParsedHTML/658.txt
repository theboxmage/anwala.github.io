The 2018 Winter Olympics kicked off in style at PyeongChang Olympic Stadium in Pyeongchang-gun, South Korea, on Friday. While the Parade of Nations at the Summer Olympics features bright and elaborate uniforms, the freezing temperatures for the Winter Games meant big coats, beanies and boots.
There were still a handful of countries that stood out from the rest. Whether it was a poncho, metallic tone or sleek all-black ensemble, these are the eight uniforms that caught our eye.

The Ralph Lauren-designed sportswear included a red-white and blue jacket with blue beanies with U.S.A. written in white and blue jeans. What made these uniforms stand out was the knitted sweater and the suede gloves with fringes.

Last but not least, a special shout-out goes to Tonga flag bearer Pita Taufatofua, who once again treated the world with his shirtless presence.
Taufatofua shot to fame during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro when he also walked shirtless and oiled-up at the opening ceremony in Brazil. For these Winter Games, he is competing in cross-country skiing.

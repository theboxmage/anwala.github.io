Vincent was born on February 6, 2018 weighing 7 pounds 11 ounces, with a full head of hair. For Thursday’s event, staff swaddled Vincent in a red, white, and blue blanket, and he wore a red, white, and blue cap, which was knitted by one of the nurses.

In honor of his win, Vincent received a plaque and “bragging rights.” Soon after the event, he went home with his parents and Ciccone plans on watching the opening ceremonies while adjusting to life with a new baby.
“That is one of my favorite parts of the Olympics,” she said.

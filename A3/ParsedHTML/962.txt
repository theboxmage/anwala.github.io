U.S. alpine skiing downhill star Jackie Wiles (Portland, Oregon) will be unable to compete at the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018, according to the United States Olympic Committee and U.S. Ski & Snowboard. Wiles suffered injuries to her left knee and leg Saturday (Feb. 3) in a crash during a world cup in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, won by teammate Lindsey Vonn.
"We are all extremely disappointed that Jackie suffered this injury so close to the Games,” said Luke Bodensteiner, U.S. Ski & Snowboard Chief of Sport. “It’s a big loss to our alpine ski team, especially after her very strong results this season. We will do everything we can to support her in her rehabilitation and we’re already looking forward to seeing Jackie back in competitive action, stronger than ever, as soon as possible.”
Wiles is one of three U.S. athletes to score a podium finish in women’s downhill this season with her third-place finish in the event in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, and a fifth place in the downhill at Lake Louise, Alberta, to open the speed season.
The USOC and U.S. Ski & Snowboard have not yet determined if her spot will be replaced under the team quota.

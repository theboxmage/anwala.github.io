Akwasi Frimpong had the first part of his dreams come true when he lifted the flag of Ghana during the Winter Olympics opening in PyeongChang, South Korea. 
He is Ghana’s only entrant in the fames and prays to make it through all the heats over a two day period and hopefully win Ghana and Africa’s first medal in the men’s edition of the sport of skeleton as a competitor from tropical Ghana at the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Frimpong shared his excitement on social media saying: A’ moment I will cherish the rest of my life. #Ghana to the world. Let the games begin! #DaretoDream!‬”
On Thursday, Feb 15, the first two heats in men’s skeleton starts at the Winter Olympic Games of PyeongChang in South Korea. The following day will see the third heats for men and also decide the world champions in the fourth and final heat.
Akwasi Frimpong is Ghana’s sole representative at this year’s games which will see Ghana make her second appearance at the Winter Olympics. Ghana was first represented at the Winter Olympics in 2010, missed the 2014 games and bounced back in 2018 with Frimpong.

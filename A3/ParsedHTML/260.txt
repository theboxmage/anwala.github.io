Coverage of the XXIII Olympic Winter Games is scheduled to begin on Wednesday, Feb. 7 in PyeongChang, South Korea with a live stream of a new Winter Olympic event, mixed doubles curling. The opening ceremonies will take place two days later on Friday, Feb. 9 because, I suppose, you can keep men and women from curling together for only so long. The closing ceremonies will take place on Sunday, Feb. 25. You can see the full schedule of events here .

Live streaming online
Each and every Winter Olympic event will be available to stream live and on-demand on NBCOlympics.com on computers via the NBC Sports app on phones , tablets and connected TVs . (The NBC Sports app is available for iOS or for Android as well as the Amazon Fire , Apple TV ( $179.00 at Walmart ), Comcast X1, Chromecast , Roku, Windows 10 ( $92.99 at Amazon.com ), Xbox and select Samsung devices.)
The catch is that you will need to prove that you are pay TV subscriber to access the live streams. Without authentication, you will be able to stream 30 minutes of coverage on your first visit and five minutes each day after that. Authentication is a drag, but then again, NBC did shell out $4.38 billion for the rights to broadcast the four Olympic Games from 2014 to 2020.
What's the difference in time zones between PyeongChang and the US?
PyeongChang is 14 hours ahead of New York and 17 hours ahead of Los Angeles.
Which Team USA athletes have the best chance at gold?
Mikaela Shiffrin won gold at the 2014 Games in Sochi in slalom ski racing as an 18-year-old, becoming the youngest slalom champion in Olympic history. She's the heavy favorite to repeat in the slalom in PyeongChang and is among the favorites in giant slalom and combined (a mix of downhill and slalom). She may even race in the speed events, downhill and Super G.
After missing the 2014 Games in Sochi because of a knee injury, ski racer Lindsey Vonn is set to race in downhill and Super G. She won gold in the downhill and bronze in Super G in the 2010 Games in Vancouver.
Snowboarding legend Shaun White won gold in the halfpipe in 2008 and 2012, but finished fourth in 2014. He will be looking to add a third gold medal to his collection in the halfpipe in PyeongChang.
Only 17 years old, snowboarding phenom Chloe Kim is favored to win gold in the halfpipe. She qualified for the last Winter Games just to prove she could; at 13 years old  she was too young to compete.
Two-time US champion Nathan Chen is among the gold-medal favorites in figure skating. He is the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps during a performance. (That is roughly five more than I can do.)
Short-track speedskater Maame Biney was born in Ghana and moved to the US when she was five. She'll be racing in her first Olympics as a 17-year-old and is the first African-American woman to make the US Olympic speedskating team.
Are there any new events making their Olympic debut?
Yes, these Olympic Games will introduce four new events. In addition to the aforementioned mixed-doubles curling (one male, one female and six stones per team), you can check out big air snowboarding (huge jumps and lots of flips and twists and other tricks), mass start speed skating (the madness of short-track speedskating on the long track) and team skiing (the mixed doubles of alpine skiing).

Here is what had social media talking during the 2018 Winter Olympic Opening Ceremony:
1. The resemblance these Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un impersonators have to the real things is uncanny.

2. The shirtless Tonga flag waver has returned to the Olympics. He gained popularity at the Rio Olympic Games in 2016. The cold of PyeongChang would not prevent a repeat performance from two years ago.
It’s 22 degrees in PeoyongChang, but Tonga’s Pita Taufatofua is still shirtless. Amazing pic.twitter.com/99lZW5hGJx

3. Team USA entered the opening ceremony to ‘Gangnam Style,’ for some reason. ‘Gangnam Style’ is a song released in 2012 by the South Korean artist Psy. The video does have over three billion views on Youtube and gained enormous popularity in the U.S., but that was six years ago…

Technically, the Winter Olympics opening ceremony took place in the wee hours of this morning, in U.S. time (Korea is 14 hours ahead of the East Coast). But NBC aired it in full Friday night, to spare Americans the struggle of waking up early on a Friday to catch all the pomp and circumstance.

The PyeongChang games kicked off with a spectacle of music, dance, and fireworks. There were also news-making moments, like North and South Korea competing under a united flag, and Russia competing under an unaffiliated one after a doping scandal. And U.S. Vice President Mike Pence sat in the same area as the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though the two did not interact. There was also a bit of drama among Team USA, as speedskater Shani Davis skipped the ceremony after losing a coin toss that would have made him flag bearer.
There was even an appearance from Tongan flag bearer Pita Taufatofua, who was shirtless for his second Olympics in a row. (He competed in tae kwon do in the 2016 Games, and is now repping Tonga as a cross-country skier.)

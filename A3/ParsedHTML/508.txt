Remsen High School will be opening its doors for viewing parties on both of those days, and all are welcome and encouraged to wear red, white and blue.
If you’ll be watching luge from home, you can tune into WKTV NBC at those times, or you can find Monday’s livestream here , and Tuesday’s livestream here .
Erin’s hometown is so proud of her accomplishments, and getting to see her carry the American flag during the Opening Ceremony is just the cherry on top. Remsen’s mayor expects it to be an emotional moment for anyone who knows her.
“I'm going to cry,” said Remsen Mayor Marty Flint. “I’m going to cry, to be honest with you, I will probably tear up. She is the epitome to holding that flag.”
“I don't think the word proud … [it] gives a disservice actually to how excited we all are,” Flint said. “Her attributes, as I stated before, not only speak volumes but she is the blueprint of what you want to embody America, and what a great representative America has chosen. We are blessed to have someone as humbled and genuine as Erin.”
The mayor went on to say that when you drive through local towns and villages and see the “Go Erin” signs and banners, that’s one person bringing neighborhoods together.
There are also signs and banners up locally that say “Go Maddie,” as Maddie Phaneuf of Old Forge will be competing in her first Olympic Games in biathlon.

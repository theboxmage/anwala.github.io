The opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics saw competitors, coaches and commentators from all over the world come together to kick off the Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea . But there was one face notably missing from the crowd: longtime Olympics host Bob Costas.
As the face of NBC Sports, Costas acted as the prime-time host of the Olympics for the past 11 Games. He also covered the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, as a late-night host. However, in February 2017, Costas announced that he was stepping down from his position.
Unfortunately, even with a year’s warning, the Internet clearly wasn’t prepared for Costas’ absence.
“I just found out Bob Costas is NOT hosting the Olympics anymore. This is a calamity?” wrote Twitter user Rachel Sanders. “The Olympics are NOTHING WITHOUT BOB.”

If the Olympics occur but are not announced by Bob Costas, did they make a sound?

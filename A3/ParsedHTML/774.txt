Now 78, Ms. Denny was one of thousands of Indigenous children taken from their families and raised in residential schools funded by the federal government and operated by churches. As most Canadians now know because of the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, abuse was widespread at the schools, which the commission determined were largely an effort to wipe out Indigenous culture.

Ms. Denny was sent to two schools run by the Roman Catholic Church. She said that when she was beaten with a leather strap by the school’s nuns and priests, she made a vow: “I wasn’t going to give them what they wanted to hear — me crying. I just held it back. Even to this day I’m like that. I hold back on crying. It kind of hurts me, you know.”
Despite that experience, one wall of Ms. Denny’s living room has two paintings of Jesus and a Christian prayer. Small statues of Jesus sit on an end table.
She told me that while she had remained a Christian, she also followed Indigenous spiritual practices, something that was strictly forbidden at residential schools.
“I pray the way I was taught in the residential school, Our Father, Hail Mary and all that,” she said. “And then, in the other ways I believe what my Granny believes. Both ways. And sometimes I think about it. Which one is true? The Catholic way or my Granny? So I just go on both sides.”

Olympic teams always enter the opening parade after Greece, birthplace of the modern Games
Greece, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa will be the first countries to emerge at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Olympic teams always enter after Greece, birthplace of the modern Games, and then in alphabetical order according to their names in the host nation's language, which has usually been Roman script.
But the Korean alphabet, known as Hangeul, starts with a sound similar to a "g" in English, followed by a sound close to an "n".
"A wise man could learn it in a morning. A stupid man could learn it in ten days."
Invented by a Korean king, Sejong the Great, as an alternative to complicated Chinese characters, Hangeul is a 600-year-old writing system used in both North and South Korea.
Hangeul is lauded for its accessibility and scientific approach.

Leaders from around the world showed up for Friday’s Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in PyeongChang, South Korea, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un were not among those present.
Or so we thought.

OK.
So those guys are clearly not Kim Jong Un and Trump. The pair of nation leaders who have been trading threats of nuclear war for the past year didn’t decide to shock the world with a friendly get-together in PyeongChang before getting kicked out for being too rowdy.
If only.
But two dudes did a damn fine job of making it look they did. From the overcompensatingly long red tie to the haircut even a 13-year-old with bad taste wouldn’t dare wear, these gentlemen got the attention they so clearly sought out.
It was attention that evidently saw them get the boot from the festivities.
Journalists from prominent media outlets saw the two throughout the PyeongChang Olympic Stadium and shared their excitement and photos on Twitter.

We may never know who these guys really are, but we’re glad they graced our digital presence to help us get into the Olympic spirit.

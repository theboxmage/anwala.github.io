Inside the 'Mind of a Medalist'
The Olympic Games are one of the most-watched telecasts in the world, thanks in part to the massive production efforts that go into broadcasting the event far and wide.
That's no different for this year's Winter Games, which opened on Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The event is an undertaking that costs billions of dollars and includes an NBC telecast that stretches across several weeks and time zones.
Some of the staggering numbers behind this year's games tells the story of an event that is constantly trying to outdo itself. NBC is pulling out all the stops and sending the most-ever number of commentators to provide insight and commentary for a record 2,400 hours of coverage.
Read below to learn more about other record-breaking stats.

February 25th, 2018 -- Date of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics closing ceremony.
$10 billion -- The estimated cost of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics . The amount is roughly the GDP of Madagascar. That's five times less than the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which was estimated to be the costliest ever.
2,925 -- Number of athletes who will compete in the games. The US is sending 244 athletes , the largest athlete delegation in Olympic Winter Games history.
39 -- The age of the oldest US winter Olympian: Hockey player, Brian Gionta. Last year, he played his 1000th game in the NHL .
50 - Miles the city of Pyeongchang is from the demilitarized zone that separates the south from North Korea. The DMZ is a border that splits the country in two, it's heavily fortified and is roughly 160 miles long.
The Telecast

BRATTLEBORO â€” Vermont may have the nation's second-smallest population, but it's set to play an outsized role at the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Nearly 30 athletes with ties to the Green Mountain State will compete for Team USA at this month's games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Vermont has the sixth-highest number of Olympians, after (starting from the top) Colorado, California, Minnesota, New York and Utah. But with one qualifier for every 48,000 residents, the state boasts the most participants per capita. And, throughout history, the fifth-highest number of winter gold medalists.
Vermonters will be able to watch live online streaming of all events if they are cable television subscribers or have paid access to NBCOlympics.com or the NBC Sports app. Those who forget the fact South Korea is 14 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time can tune in for highlights during nightly NBC coverage at 8 p.m. EST (which is 10 a.m. the following day in Pyeongchang).
Freestyle skiing, scheduled to start Friday with women's moguls qualifiers and conclude Feb. 23 with the women's ski cross, will feature four athletes with Vermont connections: Mac Bohonnon, 22, a graduate of Stratton Mountain School; Caroline Claire, 17, of Manchester Center, a senior at Stratton Mountain School; Devin Logan, 24, of West Dover, a 2014 slopestyle silver medalist; and Emerson Smith, 20, of Dover, a first-time moguls competitor.
Cross-country skiing, scheduled to start Saturday with the women's 7.5km+7.5km skiathlon and conclude Feb. 25 with the women's 30km mass start classic, will feature 10 athletes with Vermont connections: Patrick Caldwell, 26, a Stratton Mountain School graduate whose father, Tim Caldwell, competed in the sport in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984; Sophie Caldwell, 27, of Peru, a 2014 Olympian whose grandfather, John Caldwell, cross-country skied at the 1952 Winter Games; Jessie Diggins, 26, a fellow 2014 Olympian who spends her summers training in Stratton; Simi Hamilton, 30, a Middlebury College graduate who also competed in 2010 and 2014; Kaitlynn Miller, 26, of Elmore, a member of the Craftsbury Nordic Ski Club; Andy Newell, 34, of Shaftsbury, an Olympian in 2006, 2010 and 2014; Caitlin Patterson, 28, and Scott Patterson, 26, sister-and-brother graduates of the University of Vermont; Ida Sargent, 29, of Craftsbury, a 2014 Olympian; AND Liz Stephen, 31, of East Montpelier, an Olympian in 2010 and 2014.

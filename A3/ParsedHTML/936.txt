Entering the 1998 Olympic Games, Lipinski was the silver medal favorite behind fellow American Michelle Kwan. Trailing Kwan after the short program, Lipinski's long program performance earned first-place votes from six of the nine judges, making her the youngest winner of an individual medal at the Winter Games at the age of 15 years and 255 days. 
Lipinski is now a commentator for NBC and will be covering the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the coming weeks.

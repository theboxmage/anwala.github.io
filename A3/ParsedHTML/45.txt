As professional athletes entered Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on February 9 KST for the Opening Ceremony of the '2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics', they were welcomed not just by the loud audience rooting patriotically for their nations, but by K-Pop music.
With the '2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics' finally here, all eyes were fixed (or should I say ears) as trendy K-Pop music rang throughout the grand facility.  
It was a grand moment for avid K-Pop fans around the world as they were proud and delighted to listen to some of their favorite songs from their favorite artists.
Hit tracks including Psy 's "Gangnam Style", TWICE 's "Likey", Big Bang 's "Fantastic Baby", BTS ' "DNA" and Red Velvet 's "Red Flavor" were played as athletes from around the world walked with pride and dignity, waving at the spectators.  Figure Skater Kim Yuna also took the spotlight by lighting up the magnificent cauldron.

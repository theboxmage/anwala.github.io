PYEONGCHANG, South Korea —
While it is not a sporting competition, the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games is a popular spectacle and typically a hot ticket, which made many viewers wonder why the stadium appeared to be almost empty in PyeongChang.
At first glance, the telecast made the ceremony appear to be lightly attended.

In truth, more than 2,000 lower-level seats were left open for the athletes but reports indicate that the rest of the stadium was crowded.
The reason it looks empty is an optical illusion related to the bright light displays distributed at every seat and the wide camera angles necessary to capture the larger pictures composed by those lights.
The lower-angle shots, which looked up on the light displays, would occasionally reveal the silhouettes of the attendees in the stadium.

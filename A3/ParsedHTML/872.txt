Fully made in America, the look includes a red, white, and blue parka (with a self-contained heating component to keep athletes warm), jeans, and a patriotic knit sweater. Accessories include a ski hat, bandana, leather belt, boots, and "brown suede explorer gloves with fringe and hand beading."

The gloves are proving to be controversial, both for their aesthetic and their inspiration. The Cut called them "frightfully fringy," and compared them to "dishwashing gloves." In reality, the design is clearly a take on Native American gauntlets. ( See this thread from Dr. Adrienne Keene , author of the Native Appropriations blog, for more context.) Ralph Lauren, who has been criticized for appropriating indigenous imagery in the past, made no mention of the inspiration in the press materials.

Late last year, the designer gave us our first look at the closing ceremony outfit, which features a white down jacket, navy fleece pants with a red stripe, and a "vintage ski-inspired" sweater in—what else?—red, white, and blue.

Completing the look, which Ralph Lauren describes as reflecting "Polo’s iconic and authentic all-American style, infused with a modern sensibility," Winter Olympians will also wear red, white, and blue wool hats and mittens, brown suede boots, and vintage-inspired bandanas designed by the brand.

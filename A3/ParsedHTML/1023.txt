MARQUETTE, Mich. (WLUC) - Softball teams are playing for a good cause at the Superior Dome this weekend.
The Mick Campbell Memorial Softball in the Dome Tournament began Thursday afternoon, where 20 teams from around the Midwest are competing to raise money for Area 36 Special Olympics. It's the 25th anniversary of the tournament hosted by the Knights of Columbus. All of the money raised goes towards helping Area 36 athletes compete in upcoming events around the U.P. and downstate.
"The money goes towards the needs of Special Olympics and Area 36. Now Area 36 covers one-third of the U.P. - Keweenaw, Houghton, Baraga, Marquette, and Alger counties - and when these kids go to different sporting events, whether it's basketball or snowshoeing or downhill skiing or bocci ball, bicycling, or all of the other events that they're involved with, it costs money," says Charles Crotty, Financial Secretary of the Marquette Council Knights of Columbus. "Hopefully we can make a $5,000 donation this year, last year it was $3,800, and the year before was $4,200. We're up in that $4,000 to $5,000 range every year, and it's just some fantastic softball," Crotty continues.
Thursday night will feature the opening ceremonies, including Special Olympics athletes and softball players competing this weekend. The tournament will run nearly all day and night from Thursday through Saturday, and end Sunday evening where the champions will be crowned. First place takes home $1,000, second place gets $500, and third place receives $250.
"We don't make enough here to support the whole program but we do make enough to put a pretty good dent into it," Crotty explains.
Area 36 will be participating in a basketball tournament in Escanaba in two weeks. If you would like to find out more information or donate, you can visit Area 36's website at www.somi.org/area36.

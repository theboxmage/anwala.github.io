Who will be making the headlines on Sunday? These are the British competitors to look out for.
04:30-06:35 GMT: Aimee Fuller will begin her bid for snowboard slopestyle success in the qualification round at the Phoenix Snow Park.
06:15-08:10: Cross country skier Andrew Musgrave is competing in his third Olympics, but first since becoming a World Cup medal-winner. The men's 15km + 15km skiathlon is likely to serve as a warm-up to his strongest 15km freestyle event on day seven. Callum Smith, who was 62nd in the event at Sochi 2014, will also race skiathlon.

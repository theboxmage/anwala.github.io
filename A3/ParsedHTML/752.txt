Google put a Winter Games touch on their homepage this morning (Feb. 9) in celebration of the 23rd Winter Olympic Games kicking off in South Korea tonight with the highly anticipated Opening Ceremony.
The search engine hit users with an interactive artwork, this time with a clickable doodle. Titled "Doodle Snow Games - Day 1," one click of the play button transforms the homepage into a frozen rendition of the logo as a small bird flies over and perches atop the letter L.
The next scene shows a jovial looking penguin sporting ski goggles as it slides down a wintery slope, followed by a pack of sled dogs nailing back flips on their skis, and finally, a figure skating snake that hits maybe the meanest triple axel ever performed by a cold-blooded animal as crowd of animal on lookers watch. The work will be part of a series during the duration of the Olympic Games and you can also check back daily to keep up with the Doodle Snow Games.
Read more about the doodle here , and tune into the Opening Ceremony starting at 8 p.m. ET on NBC tonight.

We're heading back to South Korea's east coast to film during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics! How did we get there this time? We rode the new KTX Gyeonggang Line from Seoul to Gangneung. It only took about two hours. To drive by car would take over 3 hours! The PyeongChang Korail Pass for seven days costs 195,000 won per adult (for 5-Day Pass, 168,000 won per adult). It may sound pricey, but compared to renting a car, paying toll fees (about $40 US), and using extra time/energy to drive, you might consider it a good deal! Watch the video to see the experience :)

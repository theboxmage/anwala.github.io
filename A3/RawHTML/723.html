The relationship between the two sides has been improved. <br /><br />China supports the conciliation and cooperation between South Korea and the DPRK, and hopes that relevant parties would meet each other half way and make joint efforts to further ease tensions on the peninsula and push forward the political settlement process of the peninsula issue, Han said. <br /><br />Expressing his appreciation for China's positive role in improving the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Moon said his country is willing to maintain communication and coordination with China to push forward the inter-Korean dialogue facilitated by the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, to solve the peninsula issue through peaceful means and to achieve sustainable peace and prosperity in the region. <br /><br />Moon is scheduled to have lunch with a high-ranking DPRK delegation, led by Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly on Saturday. <br /><br />On Sunday, the 140-member Samjiyon orchestra from DPRK will bring its second concert to South Korean audience at the National Theater of Korea in Seoul. It has completed the first one in Gangneung on Thursday night. <br /><br />COMMITMENT TO 2022 BEIJING WINTER OLYMPICS <br /><br />Han met Friday with Bach, president of the IOC, saying that China attaches importance to the significant role of the Olympic Movement in economic and social development, adding that China is willing to make greater contributions to the Olympic affairs. <br /><br />China attaches great importance to and strongly supports the preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics, Han said. <br /><br />China will fully honor the commitment it made when bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics, faithfully follow the Olympic Agenda 2020, hold on to the idea of hosting the Games on a green, sharing, open and clean basis, in order to deliver to the world a splendid, fantastic and extraordinary Winter Olympics, Han added. <br /><br />Bach, for his part, spoke highly of China's preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics, saying that he believes China will deliver a green, clean, high-tech and sustainable Games.

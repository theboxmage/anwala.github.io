<p id="c2427125" thumbs="1074">What do I feel when I hear "ONE OK ROCK"? I'm so excited! Why? Becouse it's the best band I've ever heard. I can't explain this... I love them because of them. My only reason why I like them so much is that I love their characters. Toru, Ryota, Tomoya and Taka are so, so, so natural on a stage. They have amazing contact with their fans, all of the world. I was at ONE OK ROCK's concert in London. It was the best experience in my life. they made awesome performance and awesome show! I think that they can do this again at everyone of their concerts, on the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020 too. So I think they're the best band to give performance at this time! Do you agree with me, Clockers? MAKE SOME NOISE!</p>
<p id="c1825211" thumbs="773">They are the best band ever!</p>
<p id="c2427486" thumbs="588">They are an absolutely great rock band and recently, they are starting to get the recognition they deserve not only in Japan and Asia, but also in Europe and America. Their lyrics are so positive and their melodies are not banal. The members are modest and really respect their fans and you can see how grateful they are for being able to live their dream... And, above all, the energy they give at live performances! There is no other band like that in the whole world!</p>

<strong>Hatsune Miku, sometimes referred to as Miku Hatsune, is a humanoid persona voiced by a singing synthesizer application developed by Crypton Future Media.</strong> <p id="c1803192" thumbs="1379">Far beyond a mere music artist, Miku is an icon of global cooperation, understanding, and collaboration. The Olympics should be honoured to have her grace their stage.</p>
<p id="c1810914" thumbs="996">Miku brings everyone together, for love of music, art, and life itself. I always have been amazed at the revolutionary unity which she created, bringing us all together, and then leading us into the future.<br><br>That is why I'm a Vocaloid fan. And Miku started it all.</p>
<p id="c1811153" thumbs="798">Without a doubt, Miku is the next generation of rock, pop, any kind of musical styled star with no boundaries. And her popularity is growing every hour throughout the world. Miku is pure love, pure artistic masterpiece of an exsistance that ever graced this planet. Miku brings nothing but peace and love for her fans that she embraces all over the world.</p>

<img src="https://static.thetoptens.com/logo200.jpg" alt="L'Arc-en-Ciel" class="fsrc" fsrc="https://static.thetoptens.com/img/lists/8893.jpg">
<strong>L'Arc-en-Ciel is a Japanese rock band, founded in Osaka in 1991. With a reported 40 million records sold, they were the first Japanese act to headline at Madison Square Garden.</strong> <p id="c2425692" thumbs="488">They're the best to show to the world what Japanese bands can do. Also L'Arc~en~Ciel is the band that has more fans overseas, and for me (and many fans) is the emblematic band of Japan. They are one of the few bands who have had the privilege of playing in National Stadium (3 times). For this and many reasons they are the ones who should play in the Olympics. No one will do it better than they!</p>
<p id="c2440469" thumbs="360">The best rock band Japan has ever produced. Sold out shows, world tours, pulled off an intense night at Madison square garden, beautiful beautiful lyrics and experience to top that off.<br><br>There isn't a better band to represent Japan's versatility and extent of music. From contemporary pop to electro, heart rending ballads, strong beats, to well-worn rock. L'Arc~en~Ciel has done it all and are still doing it all!<br><br>Plus plus plus, we all get to hear hyde voice open the show. So why not?<br><br>Olympics or not, Laruku are my undisputed kings.</p>
<p id="c2431504" thumbs="302">They've been around for over 20 years now. They've played some of the biggest venues in the world, including London's O2, Japan's National Stadium, and headlined Madison Square Garden in NYC. They've got a variety of songs and they cover all sorts of genres and types. Their music is beautiful and amazing and have already written songs for the Olympics, specifically the 2010 Olympics for which they created the song "BLESS". Overall, they're the best band to play at the 2020 Opening Ceremonies.</p>

<p id="c7821257" thumbs="5426">This incredibly talented young artist from Kazakhstan had his international breakthrough only recently with a sensational success at the Chinese T.V. contest "Singer 2017". He's appeared in a great number of concerts and gala events since, winning award after award, and his fanbase continues to grow at an enormous pace. Dimash wows the crowds with stellar performances of pop and folk songs from all over the world sung in their original languages. His voice is characterized by an angelic beauty, and its range of pitch and dynamics doesn't seem to know any boundaries. Dimash is stunningly handsome, and his gentleness and particularly good manners are appreciated by audiences worldwide. All these qualities would make him an ideal ambassador of the Olympic spirit. - <b>Beihilfebeleg</b></p>
<p id="c7823542" thumbs="3593">Who better to unite the world with one Voice? That would be Sir Dimash. The greatest new vocalist in the world. Do yourself a favor and listen, then you'll understand what the world is saying about this young man. Peace & Love...</p>
<p id="c7822411" thumbs="3264">He brings gifted and mind boggling vocals, passion, a huge heart and incredible presence. He is an obvious choice for this event!</p>

<em>5</em> <b>Arashi</b>
<p id="c1891169" thumbs="3510">Arashi of course! They will cheer up the ceremony and give a real taste of what's popular in Japan! Sure, some people say they don't want a Johnny's Entertainment Group but in the end if London managed to get One Direction I don't see why ARASHI can't. They are the most popular JE artist and it doesn't matter if the artists aren't intenationally known because this is Tokyo Olympics- sure; it's international but this is a ceremony to celebrate Japanese artists. It doesn't matter what the other countries think of ARASHI because they don't know the real ARASHI; the boys who have a real bond KIZUNA! They are needed in the Ceremony as any J-Pop fan would have heard of ARASHI whether they like them or not! If we want to give the world a flavour of Japan's music then it's not going to work- let's face it- ARASHI (and AKB48) are the most popular idols especially ARASHI! Arashi rocks! They can sing in Japanese- most of their songs has bits of Japanese in it any way! Long live Arashi &lt;3! ...<a>more</a></p>
<p id="c1891174" thumbs="1349">I agree! I know that there a J-POP fans, Japan lovers all over the world who we all love! But as a Japanese person, myself I know that ARASHI is the most popular artist right now (and it looks like they will for a long long time). I don't have anything against Vocaloid but in Japan, there are Vocaloid fans (usually the kids that love anime/Akihabara) but Vocaloid isn't actually that well known to kids. Some kids just haven't heard of Vocaloid because ARASHI and other artists appeal so much more! Whoever they choose, I know all the Arashi fans out there (and that is a LOT OF PEOPLE in japan) will back them up! Come on, boys!</p>
<p id="c1839195" thumbs="1122">Amazing! Simply the best! Need them there to brighten up the ceremony, and they will do just that. It would be cool to have them talking too, because they r pretty funny, though I guess it would be hard as they will have 2 talk in Japanese, so non-japanese won't be able to understand.</p>
<p id="c8346447" cinfo="new" thumbs="14">I think Arashi is Japan's best of best Idol.<br>I love they and their music, programs, and concert.<br>And I'm respect Arashi's pro mind.<br>I learned about Japanese feelings because of Arashi.<br>I also began to be interested in Japan.<br>If it was not for them, I would not care about Japan and would be locked in a world of limited music.<br>I am learning Japanese now because of them.<br>Many of my friends also keep expressing interest in Arashi.<br>I think Arashi has a lot of clout here.<br>They're making a lot of money doing things in Japan, and I know they're busy.<br>However, I think it would be a good opportunity for both Japan and Arashi if Arashi had the opportunity to perform and convey the Japanese musical ability at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics.<br>Let the world know if they are ignoring Japan's music and idol markets.<br>I think Arashi's Japonism is a good album to introduce both Arashi and Japan.<br>Arashi is also singing the Olympic song each time, so the ...<a>more</a></p>

<p id="c2424777" thumbs="266">The GazettE have always been able to understand me and they have touched my heart as I know they have touched many others around the world. They are loved and adored by their fans as they feel the same way for us and I'd love for them to have the chance to be recognized for their hard work and dedication to their music and for the world to be able to hear them play their beautiful music at the Olympics!

<p id="c2421953" thumbs="263">Even if it isn't that big, Visual Kei is still a part of Japan's culture. And I think GazettE is a great example of this worldwide, so it's only natural they would perform~! Also I really would love to see them like, come on..</p>

<p id="c2398363" thumbs="141">National anthem in the performance of Gackt is the best in the world</p>
<p id="c2433738" thumbs="107">GAckt is well respected among all of these artists, has inspired their career even the Gazette with his start with Malice Mizer. It was Malice Mizer who et the tone and still does, and is well respected by the Gazette, and many many other visual K bands. Has been a mentor figure for Miyavi and KAT-TUN. He has worked his whole life and despite health problems and set backs due to his enormous fame he manages to have a positive outlook for the sake of being a role model to anyone who would open their hearts and minds. His hope and urgency to help Japan are only appropriate to allow him to open such a ceremony which will no doubt allow the world to see Japan in a new beginning. He is the most suited representing the new and old generation of all artists in Japan and the true fire in Japanese hearts.</p>
<p id="c2420944" thumbs="105">Gackt is the greatest man in my opinion! What is worthy of attention and respect. His Outlook on life and creativity are understandable to people of any nationality. He is the best candidate for this place!</p>

<img src="https://static.thetoptens.com/logo200.jpg" alt="Miyavi" class="fsrc" fsrc="https://static.thetoptens.com/img/lists/32003.jpg">
<p id="c2425390" thumbs="151">Miyavi is becoming more and more of an INTERNATIONAL icon. He doesn't just tour Asia like most Johnny's, isn't some program like Vocaloids. He is a REAL human being and is incredibly considerate (the man once gave me tea while waiting in line on the freezing streets of San Francisco at 3am! ). He and his management go out of their way to do WORLD TOURS (and yes, by WORLD TOUR, I mean they make sure to stop by the USA for concerts, not just the airports like the GazettE. That goes a LONG way in my book).<br>He's been filming a movie in Hollywood, people from MANY other countries will at least recognize him from that if not his music. Let's put someone on the Olympic map that will have a better chance at being recognized! More likely to please audiences of all countries than anyone! And yes, with all due respect, maybe even more so than Gackt.<br>I'm a fan of all of these artists that I've mentioned (minus vocaloid), but Miyavi is by far the most deserving! He has NEVER failed to do his ...<a>more</a></p>
<p id="c2421295" thumbs="127">Why isn't our SAMURAI GUITARIST higher on the list?!<br>He's the first Japanese musician who can pride himself with so many succesful consecutive world tours and he is one of the pioneers who brought the Japanese music industry closer to the rest of the world.<br>Furthermore, his music unites people from all over the world, as he teaches us to go beyond race, gender, generation, nation, language, history, religion, and to BE ONE. I think that goes perfectly with the atmosphere at the Olympics. Not to mention his ability to completely blow people away with his insane guitar playing and his versatility of style.</p>
<p id="c2421455" thumbs="118">Miyavi is constantly sending us a message that no mather what nationality, skin color, age, religion you are music unite us all and that's also what Olympics are partially about so he's the one that should perform there and obviously ROCK THE WHOLE WORLD OUT!</p>
<p id="c8086442" cinfo="new" thumbs="3">He is cool but also full of passion. I love him very much!</p>

You MUST sing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics! Luka-sama, you have the greatest voice out of all vocaloids! Luka-sama is a goddess!</p>
<p id="c1804307" thumbs="70">She can sing in english with better pronunciation and clearance. She has a soothing mature voice which makes her sound like a rel human being which people will like who're watching world-wide.</p>
<p id="c2277647" thumbs="43">However, I prefer Rin and Len but maybe Luka should have a chance</p>

<em>16</em> <b>Scandal (Japan)</b>
<p id="c2442588" thumbs="97">The representative of Japan's girl bands! No, not girl idol groups, we are talking about an all-female band that plays instruments for real.<br><br>They are all very talented, and I love to see them in the Olympics in 2020. They are very good live, some even said they're so powerful and loud in person, more than what is presented in the recorded live version.<br><br>If that happens, I'd definitely book a ticket to Japan even a year before the events.</p>
<p id="c2448002" thumbs="67">These girls are great musicians, and all four have great stage presence. They have a very personal sound, and great song of varied style. Their albums are also progressively better and interesting. I am a Norwegian musician who has followed these girls since 2008. This is in my opinion the biggest chance Japan has for a global success band! Certainly the best all girl band since the Bangles or the Runaways, and can give any guy band a run for their money too. Please! They should be in any Olympic show!</p>
<p id="c2174994" thumbs="58">Awesome band. Kicks ass. Shows what Japan has to offer.</p>

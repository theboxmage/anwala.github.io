President Trump however, focused on mental health and didn’t even mention guns in a short address about the tragedy. \n\nJennifer Hoppe, the deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America joined Salon’s Amanda Marcotte and Alyona Minkovski on “Salon Talks” to unpack the horrific event and the lack of political action. Hoppe called mental health a distraction. “The difference in the United States of America is easy access to guns,” Hoppe said, mentioning that we don’t have higher rates of mental illness than other countries. “We should all take a moment and really think about what it means that Donald Trump and his administration’s first impulse in the face of 17 dead people, most of them children, is to find a way to spin this,” Marcotte said.

Now she’s looking to serve a “second service” by running for office in Kentucky’s Sixth Congressional District as a Democrat. McGrath joined “Salon Talks” to discuss her campaign and what motivated her to jump into politics. She says the GOP is failing to think of constituents first. \n\n“Republicans that don’t take a stand against Trump when they know inside, they know what he’s doing and what he says and what he tweets is just wrong and un-American, it’s sad to me,” McGrath said. Having more lawmakers in office with military service would make a difference in Washington, according to McGrath, because of the values and training instilled in the job. “We know how to work on a mission to get things done, even if we’re from different areas or backgrounds.” To hear more about McGrath’s story and why she thinks she can beat Mitch McConnell’s handpicked nominee, watch the video above.

I didn't fit in any of them. I walked in and they didn't know what to do with me.” \n\nTo learn more about Newell’s journey from “Glee” to Broadway and his impressive recording artist career watch the full [interview]( https://video.salon.com/m/y05yV8qy/the-glee-star-shattering-expectations?list=lzcPCDNc).

Rather than continuing over 40 years of U.S. policy to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal, the Trump administration is proposing to build new nuclear-armed weapons, including sea-launched and air-launched cruise missiles. \n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, spoke to Salon’s Alyona Minkovski on “Salon Now” about the real world implications. “They come at this from the mindset that if there are problems with the Russians and Chinese, the way we deal with that is to threaten them with more nukes,” Kristensen said. The costs could be in the hundreds of billions to build new weapons and the plans coincide with President Trump’s budget, which greatly increases spending on defense at the expense of social programs and the State Department.

Furthermore, she explains to Salon why she’s disheartened by the left’s tunnel vision on Trump’s campaign lies. “Simply exposing Trump's bait and switch is important, but to me it's not enough. I think you need to lay out some clear bold alternatives of what you're for,” she said.\n\nVanden Heuvel goes on to say that while anti-Trump sentiments may be strong enough to carry candidates in 2018, it’s a “lost opportunity” for Democrats to offer a unifying vision for the future of America.

The organizers behind the Women’s March joined Salon’s Alyona Minkovski on “Salon Talks” to discuss the unprecedented momentum that led to millions of people taking to the streets on January 21, 2017. \n\nThe march’s artistic director Paola Mendoza and organizer Sarah Sophie Flicker discussed their New York Times best-selling book, “Together We Rise: Behind the Scenes at the Protest Heard Around the World,” which documents the many challenges they faced, including debates over inclusivity. “If a truly intersectional women’s movement was easy, we would have been there already,” Flicker said. Over a year later, women have been critical leaders in countless social actions. \n\nMendoza added, “The fact that 2017 started with the Women’s March and ended with the #MeToo movement is not an accident,” she said. “It is women at the center, shaping culture, shaping the narrative and pushing the envelope towards a better country for all of us.” As for what happens next, the organizers said that they are laser focused on 2018 midterm elections.

Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of The Nation, joined Salon’s executive editor Andrew O'Hehir for a conversation around the political dangers of anti-Trumpism and the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAt the Nation, Heuvel carefully investigated the Trump movement and the counter movement (anti-Trumpism) over the past year, arriving at an important message for democratic candidates. She told Salon Talks, “I think that the Democrats have made a mistake, even progressives in the last months. Simply exposing Trump’s bate and switch is important but to me it’s not enough. I think you need to lay out some clear bold alternatives of what you’re for.” While an anti-Trump stance may be a strong enough platform to run on in the 2018 midterms, Heuvel argues that upon closer examination it’s a slippery slope that puts the party’s future at risk. “What a lost opportunity as one heads into the fuller battle,” vanden Heuvel said.\n\nTo hear more about the ideological threat of running an anti-Trump platform and the Nation’s latest issue, check out the full episode above.

Zeitz offers a detailed look into his administration and how it set into motion the idea that in a booming post-war economy you didn’t need to redistribute wealth and privilege, but rather grow the economic pie.\n\n“One way to really secure a legacy for yourself is to hire people who actually know what they’re doing,” Zeitz said.

After the trip (food included), Ray’s mind is completely changed. “The world would be so much better if we could experience a little bit of someone else’s experience,” Rosenthal said.\n\nWatch the full episode above to learn where Rosenthal’s cravings lead him, and some of the not-so-delicious outtakes.

According to the woman who coined the term, the words “say it all.” On “Salon Talks,” Tarana Burke shared where the movement is going next. “If you are somebody who has survived really any kind of trauma and somebody says to you, “me too,” then you know that if nothing else, you have a small connection between that person,” Burke said. “That small connection can be the entry place where you start your healing process.” Burke, who was named as one of Time Magazine’s 2017 persons of the year and appeared at the Golden Globes,  also discussed why she finds questions about how men should react frustrating.

In January, New York City announced a lawsuit against five major oil companies, including BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, with the hopes of getting them to pay up for the billions of dollars that preparing for rising sea levels and infrastructure planning will cost. \n\nMichael Burger, who leads a team of climate law attorneys at Columbia University, spoke to Salon’s Alyona Minkovski on “Salon Now” about how the lawsuit will move through the courts. “The possibility that these lawsuits have in addressing real change comes not from any individual decision, but from the possibility that taken together, they can force or incentivize industry to get on board with a more radical plan,” Burger said. \n\nTo hear more about the other ways that environmental advocates are getting creative in addressing climate change, watch the video above.

Salon’s Alyona Minkovski breaks down some of the most damaging policies and practices that have had an impact on people’s lives for “Salon Now.” \n\nThe tax bill is the biggest legislative achievement of the year, and while it’s being sold as a win for the middle class, it overwhelmingly benefits corporations and the wealthy. By 2025, benefits to lower-income and middle class Americans will expire and yet breaks for the wealthy will go up! \n\nWhen it comes to environmental protections, while pulling out of the Paris Accord might not be felt in daily life, Republicans have significantly rolled back laws that impact Americans across the country. That includes revoking a rule that prevented coal mining companies from dumping debris into local streams and rejecting a ban on a potentially harmful insecticide.\n\nImmigration policies have already separated families and made travel and work more difficult for many people. Trump administration’s travel ban affects people from six Muslim-majority countries, legal immigration has been slowed and arrests of non-criminal undocumented immigrants surged by 250 percent, according to government data. \n\nTrump has also legitimized hate by saying there are good people on “both sides” after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Meanwhile, FBI statistics show that hate crimes are on the rise with increases in attacks based on race, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation. \n\nTo hear more of the tangible effects and damage after one year of Trump, watch the video above.\n\nTune into SalonTV's live shows, [\"Salon Talks\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/lzcPCDNc) and [\"Salon Stage\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/5n0BV6Ub), daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on [Salon]( https://video.salon.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/pg/salon/videos/) and [Periscope]( https://www.pscp.tv/Salon).","pubdate":1514590817,"tags":"Immigration,White House,Trump,Climate Change,Hate Speech,Paris accord,nazi,Salon Now,anti-immigrant,ice raids,rax bill,immigration policies,policies","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/WrpI0hyt-720.jpg","title":"The harmful effects of Trump-era policies","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/WrpI0hyt.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/WrpI0hyt-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/WrpI0hyt-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/WrpI0hyt-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/WrpI0hyt-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/WrpI0hyt-120.vtt"}],"link":"http://jw.salon.com/previews/WrpI0hyt","duration":160},{"mediaid":"VEWVYJ0A","description":"“The Science Guy” looks back on his 1990s TV show, and why climate change education has not reflected policy change.\n\nBetween hosting “Bill Nye the Science Guy” and serving as CEO of The Planetary Society, Nye's career as a science educator means that he is also, inherently, an activist when it comes to combating climate change.\n\nNye joined Jeremy Binckes on “Salon Talks” to discuss his efforts raising awareness around climate change over the years, and to present a new documentary film, “Bill Nye: Science Guy,” which chronicles his rise from lively children's show host to national science defender and advocate.\n\n\"I am a failure!\" Nye exclaimed when reflecting back on the shows he created over two decades ago about the Earth's warming.\n\nHe blamed the fossil fuel industry for creating the schism between climate deniers and believers, saying “they have worked so hard to introduce doubt.” He went on to say that he believed climate change was discovered in the 1970s, “and we’ve done virtually nothing about it all this time.”\n\nNye implored the public to take a stand against climate deniers.\n\n“What I tell everybody is vote,\" he said. \"We don’t want everybody to be a scientist; that would be unwieldy.

It’s a small sacrifice to make for long term sustainable fishing.”\n\nWhile the Trump administration’s plan to downsize four national monuments on land received national attention and outcry from environmental advocates, the news about ocean monuments has sparked considerably less pushback. “I think there’s as much passion and support for ocean conservation, but it’s very much out of sight, out of mind.

Entitlement reform, infrastructure spending, immigration and healthcare repeal are on the plate of possibilities. However, Rothman said that infrastructure is a “dead letter” due to the 1.5 trillion dollar tax bill and its addition to the deficit. “They’re gonna give as much lip service to it as they can, but I don’t anticipate that’s gonna pass Congress,” Rothman said of the GOP. \n\nAs for midterms, “the President’s party almost always loses seats in the midterm,” O’Hehir added. “It’s a question of how many.” To hear more about the political prospects for 2018, watch the full conversation above. \n\nTune into SalonTV's live shows, [\"Salon Talks\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/lzcPCDNc) and [\"Salon Stage\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/5n0BV6Ub), daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on [Salon]( https://video.salon.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/pg/salon/videos/) and [Periscope]( https://www.pscp.tv/Salon).","pubdate":1515019343,"tags":"original video,Donald Trump,Salon Talks,Democratic Party,Democrats,Republicans,Republican Party,Politics,Foreign policy,Elections,2018 midterm elections,2018 midterms,Full Episode,Video Library,Commentary Magazine,Noah Rothman","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/JGPzq4db-720.jpg","title":"New year, new problems?","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/JGPzq4db.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JGPzq4db-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JGPzq4db-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JGPzq4db-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JGPzq4db-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/JGPzq4db-120.vtt"}],"link":"http://jw.salon.com/previews/JGPzq4db","duration":1562},{"mediaid":"1oxpToje","description":"“Long Strange Trip\" is an epic documentary about the Grateful Dead that was 14 years in the making. \n\nThe film, directed by Amir Bar-Lev, explores the Bay Area’s most famous band while staying accessible to casual fans and even non-fans. “There are very few people who are indifferent to the Grateful Dead,” Bar-Lev said on “Salon Talks.” His labor-of-love film, which was executive produced by Martin Scorsese, is the first full-length film made about the polarizing American band and it chronicles in spectacular detail the 30 years the performers spent together.\n\nThe publicity-averse music group, which was famously led by the late Jerry Garcia, eschewed typical fame and became tremendously successful in spite of its inability to produce music that would sell widely through typical music industry channels, like radio.

The acclaimed director of “Beyond Glory,” “Christina” and “Halloween Resurrection,” joined Salon’s Mary Elizabeth Williams on “Salon Talks” to discuss how a troubled boy from West Virginia ended up becoming a murderous cult leader and why he believes America’s fascination with Manson is two-fold.  \n \nAccording to Brand, there’s first an evolutionary aspect to why we’re innately enthralled by evil, such as obsessing over murders, child kidnappings and other horrific news stories. He goes on to say that he believes years of human evolution have lead to this inherent captivation with every appalling headline or story that crosses our path. “Even if it’s a thousand miles away our brains are on the alert as if it were next door. That’s the way we evolved, to worry about what happened next door,” Brand said. \n \nHowever, Brand also asserts that Manson’s throne as a pop culture icon has just as much do with efficiently wrapping up the narrative of the 1960s. “I think when it comes to Charlie, there's another answer, and it does have to do with this cultural resonance,” he said. “It has to do with this, we love narratives.

In December, the site was disabled entirely, but will it really be brought back like the Trump administration claims?\n\nSalon’s Alyona Minkovski questioned why the 17 petitions that reached the necessary quota of signatures to warrant a response were ignored for “Salon Now.” Created by the Obama administration in 2011, the online tool allows the public to draft petitions on wh.gov. If they receive over 100,000 signatures, the White House has 30 days to respond. During the Obama years, some of the most popular petitions included questions about marijuana legalization and UFOs. \n\nSome of the petitions that received the most support in 2017 targeted the president directly. A petition asking Trump to release his tax returns has over one million signatures. Others include a petition calling for Trump’s resignation, and another urging for him to divest or put all of his assets in a blind trust. \n\nWhile it seems the public may have struck a nerve, the result is a further descent into secrecy and move away from open government. Other topics that reached the 100,000-signature threshold in 2017 included net neutrality, the National Firearms Act and a request to let farmers grow hemp. \n\nTune into SalonTV's live shows, [\"Salon Talks\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/lzcPCDNc) and [\"Salon Stage\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/5n0BV6Ub), daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on [Salon]( https://video.salon.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/pg/salon/videos/) and [Periscope]( https://www.pscp.tv/Salon).","pubdate":1514590939,"tags":"Trump Administration,White House,Trump,Salon Now,we the people,cover up,open government,Obama-era","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/JrTdoKGv-720.jpg","title":"Petitions website disappears","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/JrTdoKGv.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JrTdoKGv-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JrTdoKGv-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JrTdoKGv-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/JrTdoKGv-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/JrTdoKGv-120.vtt"}],"link":"http://jw.salon.com/previews/JrTdoKGv","duration":122},{"mediaid":"76WfhWJg","description":"Wilhelmina Frankfurt, a former dancer for the New York City Ballet, spoke to Salon about her experiences of alleged physical abuse and sexual harassment by now retired NYCB director, Peter Martins. \n\nIn this video, Frankfurt described the symbolism of a recurring dream she used to have, in which Martins murdered her.

more than a week of protests over economic stagnation and anti-government sentiment in cities across Iran, what should the United States and the international community do to help those fighting for human rights in the country? \n\nReza Marashi, the director of research for the National Iranian American council, said on “Salon Now” that “these are Iranian problems, these are Iranian protesters, and there will be only Iranian solutions.” Marashi stressed that “the international community should continue to express moral support, but unless Iranians inside of Iran, in a country of 80 million people ask for more than that, then it is irresponsible and frankly patronizing” to suggest other action. \n\nPresident Trump has tweeted multiple times expressing his “support” and “respect” for the people of Iran, while calling the Iranian regime “brutal” and “corrupt.” Marashi says “it’s hard to take President Trump seriously on this issue” because Iranians are part of the administration’s travel ban. In addition, the President has not yet decided whether he will continue a waiver on economic sanctions against the country, which would impose hardship on the people he claims to support. \n\nTo hear more from Marashi, watch the video above.

Finn joined Mary Elizabeth Williams on “Salon Talks” to discuss his novel, “The Woman in the Window,” which follows the story of a New York City recluse who witnesses a horrific event while spying on her neighbors.  \n\nFinn’s debut novel, a suspenseful thriller, published in 38 territories worldwide and its film rights were already acquired by Fox for a motion picture adaptation. However, the debut novelist is no newcomer to the publishing world having worked as the vice president and executive editor of William Morrow. Of course writing a novel while holding down a full time job at a major publishing house was no small task. \"To anyone curious about pursuing some artistic endeavor, I would advise them to budget their time accordingly,\" Finn said, adding, “It probably will not be nonstop fun. Most things that turn out well are not easy.\"\n\nAccording to Finn, “The Woman in the Window” is “basically ‘Rear Window’ for the 21st century.” It tells the story of Anna Fox, an agoraphobic child psychologist who witnesses a shocking crime in the home of the neighbors she's been spying on. But given Anna's fragile mental state, and her fondness for self-medicating, even she isn't sure about what she has seen. \n\nAs a longtime fan of the mystery genre Finn said he is tired of seeing the same reductive stereotypes of female characters. “So often these characters are without hobbies or habits. They seem to exist solely to serve the narrative. You get the feeling that if these particular events hadn’t befallen them, they wouldn’t exist period,” he said. Therefore, Finn took great care to make sure his protagonist didn’t fall into these traditional mystery archetypes by giving her with pastimes like watching old mystery movies, learning French and spying on her neighbors all while dealing with her own mental health. \n\n\"I like that she's struggling with mental health issues of her own,” Finn said. \"I feel this makes her rounded and relatable . . . Drawing on that not only helped engage me with the action, but I like to think helps readers connect to this story. I wanted to write a book that has more on its brain and in its heart than your average psychological thriller.\"\n\nCheck out the clip above to hear more about how A.J.

Eighteen states are seeing raises to their minimum wage due to inflation adjustments or legislative and ballot measures passed by voters. \n\nJanelle Jones, an analyst from the Economic Policy Institute, joined Salon’s Alyona Minkovski on “Salon Now” to discuss how even a minor adjustment to wages could have an impact on people’s lives. \n\n“Every cent added to their hourly wage is really gonna make a difference for how they can support themselves and their families,” Jones said. “It matters in terms of groceries and food and rent and daycare and transportation.”\n\nAccording to EPI, wage increases will provide over $5 billion in additional wages to 4.5 million workers across the country. The lowest raise will be four cents in Alaska and one dollar in Maine. \n\nThe federal minimum wage hasn’t changed since 2009 and is currently at $7.25. According to EPI, if wages were to reflect productivity, they would be over $19 an hour. It’s been left for many states and localities to take it into their own hands to provide higher rates. \n\nWhile public opinion polling does show bipartisan support for a raise in the federal minimum wage, the figures they accept are still generally below $10 an hour. Jones says that’s because expectations are low due to wages being stagnant for years. \n\nTo hear more from Jones, watch the video above.

In recent years Manville has found success starring in some of Hollywood’s biggest movies such as “Maleficent” and more recently “Phantom Thread.” Throughout her long career she’s certainly seen how roles for women of a certain age have evolved. “I mean like 20 years ago, it felt like there was this feeling that, once a woman's over 50, well that's it, she plays older mothers, grandmothers, certainly not somebody who's interesting, funny, certainly not sexy. All of that is changing,” Manville told Salon.\n\nFrom Manville’s perspective, it wasn’t Hollywood’s desire to make more representative roles for older women that led to this change, but instead a combination of factors. She attributes some of it to actors like Meryl Streep, Helen Mirren and Viola Davis seeking non-stereotypical roles and refusing to be pigeonholed because of their age. “They're still playing women who are interested in sex and sexually active,” she said. “Of course, that is representative of real women. That's what real women want.” \n\nOlder women are interesting, funny and sexual too and audiences want to see that reflected more in the characters they see on the big screen. “No woman over 60 wants to think that her sex life and her sexuality is dead,” Manville said.\n\nCheck out the clip above to hear more about Manville’s comments on representation in Hollywood and check out Salon TV’s full episode with [“Lesley Manville”]( https://video.salon.com/m/WnvFvsV5/salon-talks-lesley-manville?list=lzcPCDNc) to learn more about her role in “Phantom Thread,” where she plays opposite of Daniel Day-Lewis, in reportedly his final film.\n\nTune into SalonTV's live shows, [\"Salon Talks\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/lzcPCDNc) and [\"Salon Stage\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/5n0BV6Ub), daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on [Salon]( https://video.salon.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/pg/salon/videos/) and [Periscope]( https://www.pscp.tv/Salon).","pubdate":1515200471,"tags":"original video,Meryl Streep,Viola Davis,Salon Talks,Entertainment,ageism,Hollywood,Helen Mirren,women roles,women in hollywood,feminism in hollywood,Video Library,Daniel Day-Lewis,Phantom Thread,Paul Thomas Anderson,Lesley Manville,Roles,Age,Maleficent","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/cajbUhwr-720.jpg","title":"Sexy roles for all in Hollywood","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/cajbUhwr.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/cajbUhwr-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/cajbUhwr-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/cajbUhwr-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/cajbUhwr-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/cajbUhwr-120.vtt"}],"link":"https://video.salon.com/m/cajbUhwr/sexy-roles-for-all-in-hollywood?list=pAQO8IZr","duration":78},{"mediaid":"5ah2AO8K","description":"When she auditioned for the Paul Thomas Anderson film, the actor didn’t know whom she was auditioning for or whom her co-star could potentially be.\n\nUpon discovering she would be working with Daniel Day-Lewis, whose career spans 46 years and three Best Actor Oscars, Vicky Krieps insists she wouldn’t have changed anything about her audition. She spoke to “Salon Talks” about how she prepared for the role.\n\nIn “Phantom Thread,” Day-Lewis, who is known for his extreme process of getting into character by way of method acting, plays the role of Reynolds Woodcock, a dressmaker who falls in love with his muse Alma, played Krieps.  \n\n“Acting with Daniel I could just hold onto acting as my profession and craft,” Krieps said. “Even if he's a method actor or if he's very serious about his work, in the end it’s just a character I'm meeting and I'm confronting with my myself as an actor.” \n\nWhile Krieps didn’t know it at the time of filming, “Phantom Thread” is said to be Day-Lewis’ final role. The actor announced his retirement from acting in a statement given to Variety by his spokesperson Leslee Dart earlier this year.

Walk home from school alone? Maybe ride a bike alone?\nAmerican mother and author Sara Zaske learned quickly that these are common place in Germany where “self-reliance” is taught to children at an early age. \n\nThe American author, who lived in Germany for six and a half years, wrote about the differences between German and American parenting practices in her book “Achtung Baby: An American Mom on the German Art of Raising Self-Reliant Children.” \n\nWhen Zaske joined Salon’s Alli Joseph on  “Salon Talks,” she explained how American parents carry too much guilt regarding their children’s independence, especially when it comes to childcare. “They [Germans] do not have that sense of guilt. At least in East Germany, childcare is seen as something good for the child. It’s good to be around other kids. It’s good to learn from other adults and have new experience,” Zaske said. “Children really need more than just two people, just their parents. They are growing up and exploring their world, which means they need to meet and interact with other people.”\n\nZaske applied these lessons to her own children and learned to embrace the German methods of parenting. And “Achtung Baby” is her way of sharing these methods with the world.

The hoax was part of a prank known as “swatting” and Finch was an innocent man. \n\nKade Crockford of the Massachusetts ACLU focuses on privacy, technology and policing and she joined Salon’s Alyona Minkovski on “Salon Now” to discuss the problem. \n\n“There’s a reason why swatting is such an effective tactic,” Crockford said. “It’s because police departments across the country have, largely in the dark, militarized to the extent that they are really hair-trigger ready to be deployed by a malicious actor like this in a prank that, unfortunately in Kansas, ended in someone’s death.”\n\nMany headlines have focused on the “deadly prank” or coverage of the suspected prankster, but police culpability is also a critical part of the conversation. “We have to ask as a society, what are we doing or not doing at a systemic level that enables these kinds of mistakes to take place?” Crockford said.\n\nMost SWAT raids do not get this kind of national attention. They predominantly happen in low-income, minority communities and are part of the broader war on drugs. The ACLU conducted a study of SWAT raids across the country and found that 80 percent were simply to serve warrants. \n\nThe FBI doesn’t require police departments to compile statistics on “swatting,” but the agency told The Verge in 2013 that it estimates there are an average of 400 incidents a year. Celebrities like Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne and Miley Cyrus have often been targets, and in many instances, including the Kansas case, the pranks originate from disputes among online gamers.  \n\nTo hear more from Crockford, watch the video above.

It’s a small sacrifice to make for long term sustainable fishing.”\n\nWhile the Trump administration’s plan to downsize four national monuments on land received national attention and outcry from environmental advocates, the news about ocean monuments has sparked considerably less pushback. “I think there’s as much passion and support for ocean conservation, but it’s very much out of sight, out of mind. You can see when there’s an oil spill, but you don’t see when fish populations are down 90 percent and so I think that’s part of the disconnect,” Johnson said.\n\nTo hear more about how the Trump administration is undoing environmental protections, watch the full conversation above. \n\nTune into SalonTV's live shows, [\"Salon Talks\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/lzcPCDNc) and [\"Salon Stage\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/5n0BV6Ub), daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on [Salon]( https://video.salon.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/pg/salon/videos/) and [Periscope]( https://www.pscp.tv/Salon).","pubdate":1515188011,"tags":"original video,Salon Talks,Climate Change,Politics,Science,climate science,Video Library,Full  Episode,Marine Life,Coral Reef,Marine Biologist,David Kanter,Offshore Drilling,Marine National Monuments,Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/M8hXm1MO-720.jpg","title":"Offshore drilling puts marine life at risk","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/M8hXm1MO.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/M8hXm1MO-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/M8hXm1MO-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/M8hXm1MO-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/M8hXm1MO-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/M8hXm1MO-120.vtt"}],"link":"https://video.salon.com/m/M8hXm1MO/offshore-drilling-puts-marine-life-at-risk?list=lzcPCDNc","duration":1314},{"mediaid":"CI0dhVaJ","description":"Even after being on the Letterman show five times, it's hard to believe you've made it, Newman says","pubdate":1491621668,"tags":"Music,Salon Talks,Entertainment,Indie rock,pop music,indie music,the new pornographers,Rock,Carl Newman","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/CI0dhVaJ-720.jpg","title":"Carl Newman of The New Pornographers on success: \"I didn't trust it for a second\"","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/CI0dhVaJ.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/CI0dhVaJ-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/CI0dhVaJ-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/CI0dhVaJ-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/CI0dhVaJ-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/CI0dhVaJ-120.vtt"}],"link":"https://video.salon.com/m/CI0dhVaJ/carl-newman-of-the-new-pornographers-on-success-i-didnt-trust-it-for-a-second?list=pAQO8IZr","duration":99},{"mediaid":"sZoob9AO","description":"Musician Gary Numan shares insight on his new album \"Savage\" and his love of good noise","pubdate":1504911963,"tags":"original video,original videos,Salon Talks,Entertainment,Video Atom,savage songs from a broken world,Gary Numan","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/sZoob9AO-720.jpg","title":"Gary Numan, New Wave legend, brings science fantasy to music in his latest album","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/sZoob9AO.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/sZoob9AO-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/sZoob9AO-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/sZoob9AO-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/sZoob9AO-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/sZoob9AO-120.vtt"}],"link":"https://video.salon.com/m/sZoob9AO/gary-numan-new-wave-legend-brings-science-fantasy-to-music-in-his-latest-album?list=pAQO8IZr","duration":88},{"mediaid":"Vt6owuF3","description":"Why does the late Charles Manson remain a cultural fascination decades after the gruesome Manson murders?\n \nHollywood director and screenwriter Larry Brand created a podcast, Hollywood and Crime’s “Young Charlie,” which explores this central question and delves into the childhood that shaped the cunning monster. The acclaimed director of “Beyond Glory,” “Christina” and “Halloween Resurrection,” joined Salon’s Mary Elizabeth Williams on “Salon Talks” to discuss how a troubled boy from West Virginia ended up becoming a murderous cult leader and why he believes America’s fascination with Manson is two-fold.  \n \nAccording to Brand, there’s first an evolutionary aspect to why we’re innately enthralled by evil, such as obsessing over murders, child kidnappings and other horrific news stories. He goes on to say that he believes years of human evolution have lead to this inherent captivation with every appalling headline or story that crosses our path. “Even if it’s a thousand miles away our brains are on the alert as if it were next door. That’s the way we evolved, to worry about what happened next door,” Brand said. \n \nHowever, Brand also asserts that Manson’s throne as a pop culture icon has just as much do with efficiently wrapping up the narrative of the 1960s. “I think when it comes to Charlie, there's another answer, and it does have to do with this cultural resonance,” he said. “It has to do with this, we love narratives. We are storytellers as human beings. We love symbols, we love things that mean more than they do.”  \n \nThe Manson murders were also symbolic for their juxtaposition at the time to the free love Woodstock counterculture that evolved throughout the decade and beyond. “Charlie conveniently fits into this narrative, the '60s narrative. It very conveniently puts a punctuation mark on the '60s,” Brand said.\n \nCheck out the clip above to learn more about Manson’s lasting influence and check out the [full episode]( https://video.salon.com/m/uKxaxEhI/a-monster-in-the-making?list=lzcPCDNc\n) to hear more about Manson’s childhood and the “Young Charlie” podcast.\n \nTune into SalonTV's live shows, [\"Salon Talks\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/lzcPCDNc) and [\"Salon Stage\"]( https://video.salon.com/p/5n0BV6Ub), daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on [Salon]( https://video.salon.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/pg/salon/videos/) and [Periscope]( https://www.pscp.tv/Salon).","pubdate":1515106109,"tags":"original video,Salon Talks,Entertainment,charles manson,Manson family,podcast,podcasts,Manson girls,Tate-LaBianca murders,Pop Culture,Video Library,Larry Brand,Serial Killer,1960s,“Halloween Resurrection\",Andrew Cunanan,Ted Bundy,\"Young Charlie\",“Christina”,Manson Murders,“Beyond Glory\",Woodstock,Bad News","image":"http://jw.salon.com/thumbs/Vt6owuF3-720.jpg","title":"The allure of terrible news","feedid":"mIPs3nSJ","sources":[{"type":"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","file":"http://jw.salon.com/manifests/Vt6owuF3.m3u8"},{"width":320,"height":180,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/Vt6owuF3-XwIdJKT5.mp4","label":"H.264 320px"},{"width":640,"height":360,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/Vt6owuF3-XVrgRg6E.mp4","label":"H.264 640px"},{"width":1280,"height":720,"type":"video/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/Vt6owuF3-rIeu3KKF.mp4","label":"H.264 1280px"},{"type":"audio/mp4","file":"http://jw.salon.com/videos/Vt6owuF3-3KUqoNh2.m4a","label":"AAC Audio"}],"tracks":[{"kind":"thumbnails","file":"http://jw.salon.com/strips/Vt6owuF3-120.vtt"}],"link":"http://jw.salon.com/previews/Vt6owuF3","duration":115},{"mediaid":"2d2qhJJV","description":"Is letting go of guilt and giving kids more freedom a better way to parent?
